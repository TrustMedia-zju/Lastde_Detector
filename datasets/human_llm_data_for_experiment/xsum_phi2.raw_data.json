He has received a three-month suspended sentence and has been ordered to knock it down by 6 June 2016. BBC News looks back at how the story has developed. In secret and hidden behind hay bales, Mr Fidler built his new home some time between 1999 and 2006. It was not spotted when planning officers visited the farm on a separate issue in 2002, inadvertently taking a picture of the hay bales (above), but not noticing the \"castle\". The hay bales were removed and Mr Fidler presented his castle - complete with ramparts - to the world. Built in secret and with no planning permission, he claimed it was immune from enforcement action due to the \"four-year rule\". This is a planning law",

Aden Flint then headed the visitors in front before half-time. But Helder Costa's volley made it 2-2, and Cavaleiro scored from the spot after Flint's handball to win it. There was more drama right at the very end of the match when Marlon Pack's header was cleared off the line, with City's players and supporters feeling it had snuck over. But Wolves survived to record back-to-back victories for the first time since August, moving them above the Robins to 15th in the Championship table in the process. City, whose manager Lee Johnson remonstrated with the referee on the pitch after full-time, slipped to 17th having lost 10 of their past 13 matches in all competitions.

In his Daily Telegraph column, he suggests Ian Bell as Cook's successor. Responding to Pietersen's comments, Cook told BBC Sport: \"Everyone is entitled to their view and I can't let it get to me.

NHS leaders are now pushing for investment to allow them to repair decaying buildings, upgrade facilities and fund new plans to develop care in local communities. If central government funding is limited, they argue, the alternative is private finance. Jim Mackey who heads the financial regulator NHS Improvement, along with other health service officials, has had discussions with private financial institutions. My understanding is that they are at the conservative end of the spectrum, for example pension funds, rather than the racier speculators seen in dramas like \"Billions\".

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money provided either by",

Walker was first picked to play for Wales against South Africa in November 2013, but was forced to withdraw because of a hamstring strain, with a recurrence in February 2014 sideling him for the rest of the season.

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year. Such lenders are unlikely to increase their SVRs until there has been a significant rise in base rates - certainly more than",

Gina Chirico, victim Mark Trussler's fiancee, said: \"We're more than happy.\" Shelley Spooner, a friend of Matt Jones who died in the disaster, said the temporary memorial would be a steel arch and people would be able to tie ribbons to it. The Shoreham toll bridge became the focus of commemorations for the people who died when a 1950s Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August. It was covered with flowers but they were eventually removed. WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith said: \"We wanted to find a place where people could have somewhere to reflect. \"We have to recognise people are grieving, this is a terrible tragedy, and there's something about having a focal place where people can go. \"We're also aware that it's coming",
        "In two famous - and famously lengthy - experiments, scientists wait for pitch to drip from a funnel. It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed. Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up. The invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama. But alongside the storytelling, Dr Kostya Trachenko is adamant there are important measurements to be made. He and his undergraduate students at Queen Mary University of London put their pitch into five different funnels, with different sized openings. Pitch, or bitumen, is the black muck left over from distilling crude oil, and can also be produced by heating wood. It is a liquid at high temperatures but becomes very hard",
        "Spain's Christmas lottery, known as \"El Gordo\" or \"the fat one\", is a national event. It has been going since 1812 and an estimated three-quarters of Spaniards and thousands of foreigners play each year. The odds are good - around a million people walk away with cash prizes - and El Gordo is the world's biggest lottery in financial terms. It handed out 2.5bn euros last Christmas. Unlike other lotteries, players do not choose numbers. They buy a ticket with a 5-digit number on and anyone who has that ticket when the the numbers are called - or, more accurately,sung out by schoolchildrenat a televised event in Madrid - wins a share of the prize. Because of the nature of the system, tickets in a series are often sold by the same vendor, meaning the winners usually come from the same towns. The draw is always held just before Christmas",

Reports say the capital, Maseru, is now calm after soldiers seized buildings. The army denied staging a coup. Lesotho has seen a series of military coups since independence in 1966. Mr Thabane has headed a unity government since elections in May 2012, but suspended parliament sessions in June amid feuding in his coalition. He denied accusations that his actions had undermined his government. Mr Thabane said the army had rendered the government \"dysfunctional\", an action that amounted to a coup. \"I have been removed from control not by the people but by the armed forces, and that is illegal,\" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. \"I came into South Africa this morning and I will return as soon as my life is not in danger.

He was speaking in Lima, Peru, where negotiators from 194 countries are heading into a second week of UN talks. They hope to agree a text that would form the basis of new global compact, to be signed in Paris next year. Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon. According to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format. \"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said. \"That, in my view, is a serious mistake. The sanctions available under the Kyoto Protocol, for example, were notionally legally-binding but were simply not credible and failed to guarantee domestic",

        "The claim: The government's figures on business rates are misleading because they exclude inflation and an appeals adjustment. Reality Check verdict: The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: \"Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.\" The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.",

The clerk of the House is the principal constitutional adviser to the Commons, and adviser on all its procedure and business. Paid \u00c2\u00a3200,000 a year, he or she is also responsible for the overall administration of the House of Commons, including the signing of leases, contracts and public expenditure on Commons services. MPs have questioned the selection of Carol Mills - who works in the Australian Parliament - to replace the former Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, who retired in July. Speaking in a debate in the Commons, Jesse Norman - who has led opposition to the appointment - said disquiet over the job raised wider questions about how the Commons",
        "When Hans Asperger first defined autistic psychopathy in 1944, he was talking about boys. He thought no women or girls were affected by the condition. This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive. A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one. A more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one. But there is growing evidence that more girls and women have the condition than was originally thought and that it is being significantly under-diagnosed. We met Millie at home in Norfolk.

        "The quantity of goods bought rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was stronger growth than economists had been expecting. The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes. That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks. \"A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,\" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year. Economists prefer to look at figures over three months, which smooth out volatile moves from month to month. \"We shouldn't get too carried away by these figures. After all, the retail sales figures are very volatile on a month-by-month basis. And the heatwave in June provided a boost to clothing sales that may",

The sector had been hit by widespread store closures and some major retailers, including Tesco, Marks & Spencer and B & M, even entered administration in 2011.\nThe study revealed similar results in the food sector: while total revenue growth in 2012 was expected to be 5.1% \u2013 higher than expected for the previous year \u2013 the sector still expected to face tough trading conditions in the year ahead.\nThe hardest-hit area of the food sector was in the food processing industry, where companies expected a 9.6% increase in sales revenue but 7.9%",
        "What force does the law allow? In England and Wales, anyone can use \"reasonable\" force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest for any offence. The law does not restrict this power of self-defence beyond this point...\nAn individual in any jurisdiction outside of England and Wales can be convicted if they carry out this act, but has only to rely on their own country's laws.\nAs this shows, there is no clear definition of \"reasonable force\".\nBut, when the police are called out to a crime scene, or when a confrontation ensues, a lot can happen in a matter of seconds.\nThis is one of the reasons why it's so important to have the right legal advice, and the right tools at your side.\nThe use of tasers by the police\nIn order to protect themselves, police officers often deploy one of the most commonly used methods of self-defence: stun guns, also known as tasers.\n",

        "For nearly a decade, the Kremlin has been busily striving to win hearts and minds around the world mainly through its flagship international broadcaster RT (formerly known as Russia Today). Russia's official language radio, the Voice of Russia, is also very accessible as a short-wave transmission (it is carried by nearly 8,000 radio transmitters worldwide). RT broadcasts primarily in English, but also has programs in Arabic, Spanish, Hindi, Dutch, and Catalan, and is also translated into several other languages. RT's English programming is, however, a relatively small percentage (about 10%) of its total programming. The vast majority of RT's Russian language programming focuses on Russian history, politics, and culture. The BBC's Radio Moscow, for example, was particularly devoted to highlighting the communist roots of the Soviet Union and its subsequent collapse, and frequently attacked the United States both during the Cold War and during the recent war in Bosnia.\nRFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages.

        "Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey. About 80 per cent said their staff were having difficulty buying basic necessities because of the weakening pound. A total of 38 per cent said migrant workers were particularly hard hit, while another 12 per cent were worried about workers becoming \"hostile\" towards them. It comes as the BHA held its annual conference in London after a tumultuous year of Brexit uncertainty and a number of high-profile incidents of food fraud.\nThe BHA is calling on the government to take action within months to improve workers' rights.\nIt wants the government to make it a legal requirement in contracts to pay migrant workers at least \"living wage\" or face significant penalties for not enforcing it.\nIt is also calling for the government to set out plans to ensure farmers can continue to employ as many workers as they need.\nThe report by the National Farmers' Union (NFU)",
