I think this is a bit of an over generalization. Yes some shoes are extremely narrow for the sake of fashion but these are typically shoes meant to be worn for shorter periods of time like high heels or maybe a narrow men\u2019s dress shoe. Most every day shoes are not cramming people\u2019s feet into tiny little spaces. If your shoes are doing that, you need to either move up a size or find a different brand. People also naturally have different sized feet. My feet personally are very narrow and don\u2019t have an issue with really any shoe unless it\u2019s actually too wide. Some people have wide feet and many brands offer wide width varieties of their shoes. You also got this information from a commercial which is trying to",
        "Why are Animals able to gorge themselves with days worth of food, but Humans can't. The notion of \"apex\" predator\" is flawed in a lot of scenarios regarding animals. Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators. This rarely happens because rarely there is an animal that is able to localize and identify such vulnerable individuals to exploit and do opportunistic predation, as well as the risk of injuries. When an animal have higher sociality and engages",

A lot of pathogenic bacteria will, too. But some can survive in the environment without a host, or can ensporulate (basically dry up and form an impermeable coating that preserves dormant genes and cell machinery). * One particularly nasty example of spore-forming bacteria would be [C. botulinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum), the bacterium responsible for botulism. * Botulinum toxin is ounce-for-ounce one of the deadliest biological agents we know of. * C. botulinum is a common soil bacterium that gets on random surfaces all the time.

The rocks don't move much, right? They just sit there. In the ocean, there are animals that are a bit like these rocks; they don't move much and might even look like rocks. These are animals like corals and barnacles. Why are they there in the ocean, but not on land? Well, it's because of how they live and what they need to survive. In the ocean, water moves around a lot, bringing food to these \"rock\" animals. They can just stay in one place and grab food as it floats by. It's like if you could sit on your couch and have snacks come to you! But on land, it's different. Animals need to move around to find their food because it doesn't just float to them. Imagine",

There was no science behind the target of 5 by the way, it was chosen as a nice easy to remember number and obviously eating veg is good for you generally. If you have good kidney function and aren't ill or sweating loads, you don't necessarily need 2 litres of water. Basically the requirements are different person to person.

        "- Why is it so easy to overwater a plant, but sticking the roots directly underwater is how you propagate it? As long as the roots have oxygen, they will survive. This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering. If your plants live in a well drained sand/silt/clay mixture, you can water as much as you want and the plant will never ever rot. Water has oxygen in it when it rains or we water, so there has",
        "Why are there no green mammals? Firstly, there is a green mammal. The sloth. They are generally covered with a layer of algae that does help them blend in. Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration.",

It's important to understand that fluoride already occurs naturally in many sources of drinking water. In fact, in some places, the natural mineral water contains significantly *more* fluoride than is recommended to reduce tooth decay, and the excess is removed. Basically, the recommended levels of fluoridation are known to be generally beneficial, and are known not to be harmful, and are well within the bounds of what might be found in nature anyway, and the fluoride is cheap and fluoridation is easy. This is a pretty unusual confluence of factors. Why should we expect the same to be true of, say, Vitamin C? Most people get more than enough of that",

        "why did us humans become way taller from 1900 to 1990? Is there a scientific reason to it? Why are we not becoming any taller in recent years? I have an explanation for this. It is the squad keying method of modern combat. Modern combat keeps the keying of the person within one key and for all combatants the designation of the friendly is the key of C and associated and the enemy to be determined lurks outside of C. The egress point from C to the enemy in B is the resolvation G from a one or two bar of C. The common way to do this yields that people are fatter and taller especially, as the method yields octave resolvation which ultimately expand the keying of the person on a time basis towards being quite tall and weighty towards the end of the phase, and especially smaller at the beginning of the phase as the method starts with a single squad member, C2 or C3. For example, progression 1X12-9X15",

Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer. However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure. The narrowing can also affect the electrical activity causing the heart to become",

Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing. Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. Humans are specialized in... well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances. Our arms can't easily haul our body weight up a tree or be used for walking, but can accurately throw things, build tools. Once humans started building tools natural selection greatly preferred the most nimble, flexible hands and arms that could make better tools, and larger brains that make better tools.

Unfortunately this new fat cell creation was post menopause and thus her body distributed it more like a male with most of it going on the belly viscerally.

There's a combination of reasons. The most significant one is that cheese mold itself usually isn't dangerous. Most varieties of mold that commonly grow on cheese just changd the flavor. They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content. And if you have a hard cheese like cheddar, and it gets wet and then molds, it's also not safe because of the moisture. Then soft cheeses like Brie, you'll get opinions both ways.

        "why you never hear about the human heart getting cancer, are there other organs that don\u2019t get cancer? The heart muscle itself, not so much. It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right atrium of the heart. You can also develop chemodectomas (tumors of special",
        "how can insects survive a slap from humans, a creature that's gigantic compared to them A matter of scale. Resistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section. The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*. But area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry. Imagine an ant being the size of an elephant.

You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. Secondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%).

Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. This is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains.

If not, it doesn't. Probably. This all has a random element to it, and there are all sorts of factors involved. In the case of dinosaurs, it is tricky to know how smart they got, but some may have been as smart as modern big cats. Some modern dinosaurs (birds) can be pretty smart as well.

Similarly, it bothers me when people require a purpose for a specific animal or species to exist. We can assign a benefit to the ecosystem. But it's usually arbitrary. Things just be. And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed. If you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier.

Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first.

At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy. This chemical that",

Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got.

Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva.

One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel. Teeth need to be whitened with something that can oxygenate the enamel and allow the bleaching effect to take place.

        "How does an alcohol overdose kill you? Hi there. simply put, you have two chemicals that either speed your brain and body up, or slow them down. GABA slows it down, glutamate speeds it up. They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't stop, which will eventually make you stop breathing because the muscles can't coordinate.

In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain.

They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth.

They go from ramen and sparse finances justifying fewer meals to having more money and eating more in a sitting because their control was dictated by their wallet and not their constitution and habits.

They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this.

If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise.

Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference.

An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb.

I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose.

Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries.

        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic.

And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster.

The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit. To anyone who finds this interesting: there\u2019s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels.

If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones.

        "Why is asbestos so much more dangerous than other'sharp' dusts like fibreglass? JESUS CHRIST. These are the most confidently incorrect answers I've seen in a while. Of the five main types of Asbestos fiber, the most commonly used type is Crysotile. The main hazardous characteristic of it is that when it becomes *fryable* the fibers tend to break into shards that have a weird physical structure that results in the ends of the fragments to have curled, hook-like ends that resemble microscopic velcro. The hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively. This results in the particles remaining in the body for MUCH longer, and that causes a body to resort to other means of self-preservation, such as encapsulation. When the body encapsulates an asbestos fiber, it deposits calcium around it and forms a layer of scar tissue around the deposit. One",

Harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-splicing system is completely changing the outlook for this type of sickness. CRISPR-Cas9 is an immune system for bacteria. It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body. CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to remove a genetic disease (sickle-cell anemia) from patients, using a custom-designed one-time serum that the doctors injected into the patient. It's a little more complicated than that, but CRISPR is the core of that method. Retroviruses, like HIV, are insidious because they splice",

Those receptors help your brain and body know you\u2019re tired. When you block them with caffeine, you just feel more awake while the caffeine is working. Cocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors. So you get a build up of dopamine in the synapse and it amplifies the effects of the dopamine. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so addictive- you\u2019re getting like huge hits of dopamine (which is a natural brain chemical) but in a super unnatural way.

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed. It passes through much quicker and everything in it will be absorbed much quicker. This can lead to a rapid rise of",

The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work. The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work. The square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume grows faster (cubically) than surface (squarly), which also (usually) means that mass will grow faster than the support structure for that mass.

Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That\u2019s 165 \u00baF / 74 \u00baC. The appearance and texture will be different due to the difference in myoglobin and fat content. The higher fat content in duck meat makes it juicier and more moist compared to chicken. The higher myoglobin content will make it look more like what we associate with medium rare from steaks. The chance of chickens carrying food borne pathogens like Salmonella is higher than that of ducks because of how chickens are farmed compared to ducks. Much more extensively and in more crowded conditions. That means the meat has a higher chance of being contaminated when the",

While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night.

        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet) for at least 3 minutes. We also avoid flying for at least 24 hours after",

YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva.

It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it.

The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly.

All in all the liver is about making things you want more available to you, and making wastes easier to excrete. The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and the stomach, it's the first pass which tries to balance everything in a way that works for your body. The liver breaks down large molecules into smaller and more easily absorbed ones as well, it does a LOT of different things really. The liver is also involved in producing bile salts, recycling compounds from our own dead cells and more. Your kidneys can be thought of as the other end of that sort of job, the kidneys (ideally) filter your entire blood volume a couple of times an hour. One of their primary jobs involves",

The thinking is if anyone in the species had a mutation that would result in more offspring of one gender, that would make the other gender have a greater chances of finding a mate and make having children of that gender preferable to pass on your genese. Whenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender. So like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle. That said 50/50 is not the real ratio in humans. It is just the approximate ratio of humans during their main reproductive years.

In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to.

You can reflect on things that just happened and analyse the past to learn and grow, and also can comprehend that a future exists and begin to understand how it could pan out. It alters your perception of literally the tiniest experiences, and I mean not just knowing language, but people who speak different languages think differently because of the way their brain processes information.

The same way when you eat lots of super salty food you will notice the next day your fingers are more swollen, it\u2019s because salt makes your body hold on to fluids making it hard to take a ring off the next day. But if you drink lots of water the day after, you can flush out all that extra salt and now your fingers aren\u2019t swollen and you can remove your rings easily again. Our bodies typically maintain an important balance between how much salt/water circulates on its own, and literally flooding the system with either one will have side effects ranging from minor like swollen fingers to fatal.

        "How do babies learn a language when they are not taught it in a structured manner? These answers may be correct, but they do not have much linguistic basis. Babies are born with systems that help them learn language. One of these is Universal Grammar.

This is a widely accepted theory from the famous linguist Noam Chomsky. However, the system has to be \u201cpowered on\u201d. Babies need exposure to language in order to actually develop language.

As an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination). The band is then left in place to prevent blood form flowing into the leg and thus from bleeding into the surgical site. Another way hemostasis is maintain, is through Electrosurgery, commonly referred to as bovie. The use of an",

Often like 2/3 the amount of carbs of normal sugar candy so those candies arent safe either.

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful molecules, for example, converting Tyramine (found in certain foods) in foods",

Normally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. Progestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it. It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. Progestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant.

There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it.

Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that\u2019s strong enough to allow for incredibly complex chemistry and yet won\u2019t dissolve the molecules that make up the organism.

This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y\u2019know, live. The way carbon forms strong covalent bonds with itself means it can form molecules like DNA in a way that other atoms just can\u2019t.

        "Why does salt make everything taste better? Why do humans like it? Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain wrong. Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed. If it's too \"quiet\", not enough of the food to taste, or it's bland, we may not taste something if it never reaches the threshold. So what does this have to do with salt? Some neuron cells have what are",

Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it.

Then, think about the evidence that supports your response.\nDetailed answer: Sensory systems and perception can vary among different organisms and are subject to debate. However, in the case of oysters, they do not have a central nervous system which means they lack the capacity to experience emotions such as fear. Evidence from neuroscience and animal behavior supports this argument, as oysters do not exhibit behaviors that would suggest fear or any other emotions. Therefore, it is unlikely that oysters can experience emotions such as fear. \n\n",

While these things may not sound good, the truth is that as an individual's fitness increases, his or her body becomes stronger. Blood pressure goes down due to better circulation, heart and lungs become stronger. Blood glucose levels are maintained more stable as your body becomes more efficient in processing the carbohydrates in your blood and tissues. Finally, as we get in better shape, we are more aware of what we eat and more",

The human hearing range is between 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Horses and other equines may hear up to 60 kHz.7\nThe upper frequency limit of our hearing is dependent on the frequency of the sound and the sensitivity of the auditory apparatus, which is why we don't hear at 60 kHz all the time; it's the upper limit. If you could use your human ears at 60 Hz, you'd see sounds like the clicks of flies and the rustling of leaves. The horse's ear is also more sensitive to higher frequencies than ours",

It is usually pasteurized before its refrigeration. This is the milk that is found in the cooler bins at your market. However, pasteurized fresh refrigerated milk can also sit on the shelves for several days since it's still in a sterile container.\nSo what is UHT?\nUHT stands for ultra-high",
        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They also argue that for the memories that do exist, they are more likely to be forgotten than remembered because the recall process uses far more resources than the actual retrieval process.\nAnother factor is because younger children have very limited life experiences compared to older children and adults. Memories created from these limited experiences will be less detailed and less vivid than memories that are consciously created by someone with many different life experiences and a larger life perspective. While some children may begin to remember specific details of past events in their early years, most people have very limited access to their earliest memories. In most cases, these memories only become apparent when a person is facing a difficult situation or crisis. In these situations, memories from very early on are needed to give a person strength and resolve to go through problems. Therefore, it is not surprising that people have no memories from before age 4",
        "If we use alcohol as disinfectant, why drinking it doesnt solve throat infection / sore throat? Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral only, it can be fungal or allergic. So even if there were bacteria in the throat, the alcohol isn't likely to do anything more than simply kill them. - alcohol is only an antibacterial product, it has a very low kill rate on mold and viruses (the kind of thing that's floating in the air and coming through your nose and mouth). - many throat infections and sore throats are caused by viruses (a flu virus, for instance), so alcohol is not the best solution even if they were to be caused by bacteria.\nYou want to clear a phlegm from your throat.

        "If holding bladder is harmful, why isn't it an issue while sleeping? When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (ADH), which makes your kidneys produce less urine during sleep. This is because, when you're sleeping more you aren't as active, hence not losing much fluids too. So, for those wanting to reduce the amount of time spent on the toilet, the solution is to cut down on fluids throughout the day. To help, make sure you drink enough water throughout the day to keep yourself hydrated.\nWhat happens if you drink too much water before you go to bed?\nYou may wake up during the night to urinate (or find your bed is wet in the morning).\nYou can experience side effects like dehydration, confusion and even comas.\nDrinking cold fluids before bed can lead to a temperature shock in the body, so warm or room temperature drinks such as teas, water and milk can be used instead.\n",

Can it ever be possible for any fat or cellulite to be permanently removed from the body other than being dieted away, by way of burning fat cells with weight loss or exercise?\nNo, I personally do not believe that it is possible to remove cellulite from a human body other than dieting the fat away. Fat can disappear through exercise or simply by losing the weight. Many overweight and obese people often go on fad diets or weight loss programs. Such programs require the person to lose a lot of weight in a short period of time. This usually takes a very intense amount of weight loss.\nThere is a specific weight loss diet that has been around for some time called the \"5 and 1\" diet. The \"5 and 1\" diet suggests that a person who is struggling to lose weight should diet for 5 days a week",
        "Why does it feel good to use a q-tip in your ear when it's bad for you? As an audiologist I recommend against this. If you clean with a q-tip, you risk pushing particles inside the ear further up, or into the eardrum (perforation). It can also cause an ear infection and irritate the skin of the external ear canal. So what should you do if your ears are dirty? Ear wax (cerumen) is a yellowish substance produced by glands in the lining of the ear canal. Ear wax protects the ear canals from water and dirt. Normally, the ear produces earwax that flows out of the ear canal on its own as the canal dries out, removing any debris it may have collected. A cotton swab can't get all of the earwax out since the tip of the swab is too small. Cotton swabs or other tools don't help, cleaning and removing earwax, and can",

        "why do babies sit with perfect posture when they learn to sit, but the older you get, the worse it gets? It\u2019s actually because that\u2019s how it should be.\nIf you look at a new-born baby\u2019s head, neck and spine in a sitting position, they are stacked in what is called the neutral alignment. This creates the strongest stability. As the baby grows up, the muscles grow stronger, allowing them to use more of their body weight while sitting. However, this also brings in an inherent instability, since it is harder to control the movements of all these weight-bearing muscles, so that the spine is held in place more by active restraints, such as the deep muscles, and passive restraints, such as the spinal discs.\nThis instability can cause pain. Since the newborns are more flexible, they are easier to manipulate and get into good postures, especially by people with the correct knowledge and training. Older people are stiffer and",

So, when eaten in their natural state as part of a balanced diet, they have fewer undesirable effects.\nIn addition, the fiber slows down absorption of the sugar and the high water content increases satiety. Furthermore, the phytonutrient and carotenoid antioxidants provide further protection for your blood vessels and lower the risk for stroke.\nAnd here is a link to the latest article: Eating an orange is better than drinking orange juice for your blood sugar\n2 comments:\nThe best way is to use fresh squeezed juice",

Dogs, cats, and a lot of other land animals, especially predators, can swim pretty well, and, according to several well-known evolutionists, many of these species evolved the ability to swim a great while ago.[3] This suggests that the ability to swim may have been a relatively simple adaptation to an early sea environment, one which was then followed by other complicated adaptations involving other senses.\nAnd when it comes to human evolution, I don't see any reason why the inability to swim would have had much impact on our ancestors. Humans evolved in Africa, where not only did our ancestors (like humans themselves now) swim in the rivers and lakes of Africa, but they had to swim and use their hands and their feet to get around.[7]\n1/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkJyNuJ9G_c\n",

Ducks are different from chickens which leads us to question why should duck meat be red when chicken meat is considered white?\nThe duck meat is red because of the animal's diet and its lifestyle, especially during the time they grow. In other word duck meat get its red color from the pigment, that we know as haemoglobin which is the same pigment in red meat. So it does not mean that the amount of haemoglobin is high just because we look at a duck's red meat as red.\nOne of the reasons why duck meat is red is because it gets its red color from its diet and the environment where it lives.

        "What has caused maternal mortality to rise so dramatically in the US since 2000? To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, and particularly the black/white disparity, accounts for one-sixth of the increase in maternal mortality worldwide between 1990 and 2010. This study also finds that approximately half of the maternal death gap cannot be attributed to socioeconomic status because the US is among the top 10 advanced countries with the highest levels of income and education.\nThe CDC studies suggest several possible explanations. The most salient are:\n1. Unintended pregnancies and teen births: Maternal mortality increases as the age at the time of the birth increases. This means that pregnancy and childbirth complications are a greater risk for young women with low educational attainment and high poverty \u2013 people who, as we also know, get pregnant by choice when they are young or by circumstance when they are unprepared.\nFurthermore, this means that unintended pregnancies and teen births are a significant contributor to rising maternal mortality as young",
        "What do our sinuses actually do? Not really. This ELI5 answer misses the point completely. First, the rate of air flow though the sinus is miniscule, much less than if the sinus had become a hollow organ. Second, sinuses don't actually absorb moisture from the air. That function belongs to special glands at the top of your nose, far away. What do our sinuses normally do, then, is trap large foreign bodies that we breathe in, such as food, dust, and bacteria (and, believe it or not, bits of feces). These small invaders block the air flow through the nasal passages, allowing us to sneeze at them and blow them out, so they don't get into the lungs.\nFor the most part, we do not need to open our sinuses, although this may happen occasionally if the sinuses get blocked and unable to clear themselves by sneezing or blowing your nose.

The longer the typical age of sexual union the less female offspring are born. For instance, in our species the typical female age of childbirth is 25-27 years of age. This means that the probability of any female giving birth a child is about 0.5 only if she is under 5 years out of school.

        "Why the elderly body odor is so strong? As a person ages the body naturally slows down. This includes all parts of the body. Whereas a younger person has a much faster metabolic rate and higher enzymes. The body therefore also burns up body fat faster and produces more waste with it (fats and fats). These chemicals and waste are released through sweat glands. In addition to the lack of enzymes, the older person has a lower body temperature. This inverts the sweat to a greater extent. This means that a perspiration becomes more concentrated. Hence, a stronger odor is released.\nBecause the elderly person has a lower temperature, the perspiration also evaporates more slowly. In contrast to a younger person.\nThe elderly person, besides this, is also in the danger zone, that is, there is a high risk of many infections.

The field of neuropsychology studies memory, perception, attention, and language in connection to the brain and nervous system. Since language learning and plasticity occur across the lifespan, the brain's natural ability to learn needs to be studied from birth to death. To answer some of the basic research questions, experimental psychologists must first identify how the brain processes information and stores facts, as well as the basic ways in which people use different forms of language to communicate, think, and interact with others. A language faculty or module of the brain exists, but there is still much to be learned about its development and use (e.g., its relationship to other types of memory, such as phonological, or word-sound, memory).

A simple rule of thumb is that if someone has high blood pressure or circulatory issues when sitting and standing straight the risk of circulatory problems increases significantly.\nThe good news is that many circulatory conditions can be reversed by exercising regularly, lowering stress, and making some simple lifestyle changes.\nHow to improve blood flow after a long day\nYou\u2019ve heard it a million times throughout your life, \u201cYou have to move to stay healthy,\u201d and research backs up this common adage. In a study published in December 2016 by the American",
        "How does your body burn 2000 calories a day, but you have to run a mile to burn 100 extra? Your question stems from the fact that we are constantly on the go at work or at home, we are moving and doing chores, whether it be walking to the car, cleaning and dusting, etc; yet, we still don't seem to go past 100 minutes without running out of breath. So how much more calories are really being used?\nTo see how much calories you burn throughout the day, you might track your movements using a fitness wearable. One of the most popular fitness trackers currently available today is the Fitbit. Once data is captured, the most recent research shows that the average \"healthy young man (205 lbs) burns 1,700 calories a day walking as part of his job, and another 1,400 calories a day at home.\" As you can see, they don't have to be training for a marathon\u2014so how do you lose weight in a day",
        "What happens to your body when you participate in a marathon Long distance running problems/risks (and the things you describe) in no particular order:\n- The glycogen stores in your liver and muscles have been fully depleted\n- Your body starts to feed on the lipids in your visceral fat cells\n- Your body resorts to breaking down its own protein stores\n- Your muscles start to waste away\n\u201cA recent research study of runners who had completed two marathons found an average of 8% loss in muscle strength over a six week period. Runners who had completed 10 or more marathons also experienced a 15% loss in muscle strength\u201d\u2026.

        "How exactly does food poisoning work? How does the body know that the food is contaminated and which way to expel it out? How does it know when a certain food item is harmful and dangerous? After studying food science at school, I know these questions could be answered by the fact that food is always meant to feed the body. The body is supposed to absorb all the nutrients that are contained in the food, not just for energy, but for proper functions as well. This doesn\u2019t mean that the body will accept all the food that it is fed with.\nHow does Food Poisoning Start?\nFood poisoning occurs when your intestines get disrupted by harmful bacteria. These bad bacteria invade the food and attack your intestines. This damages the cells of the intestine that can absorb food. This is the main reason why food poisoning makes you sick to your stomach. The body gets rid of these bacteria once you feel sick. Your body tries to purge out the food item by throwing it out",
        "Why is water essential for life on other planets? Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that\u2019s strong enough to dissolve all of the stuff required of it: water! Water is a universal solvent, a chemical that can dissolve many other chemicals. Without water, we wouldn\u2019t be able to dissolve most of the stuff required for life, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to exist. Our planet is covered in water, both in the oceans and as rain. When the rain falls, the water is collected in rivers and lakes, where we drink and use it for industry. The oceans, however, are so massive that they\u2019re pretty much the only source of water on our planet; they\u2019re like giant reservoirs that hold water in the form of freshwater. The oceans, though, are also our only source of oxygen, so we have to breathe through a process called photosynthesis that requires sunlight to produce it. Without water",
        "Why puking gives us so much relief after feeling sick and nauseous? \"Because the process of vomiting is really hard on your body, and it puts your digestive system off-kilter in the short term. So when you get over the episode, it feels like a huge relief when it's gone, and you can start regaining fluid and nutrients. But the relief does come at the price of being really, for a while, totally weak.\"\nIt takes time to recover physically from vomiting, which means a period of rest and recuperation \u2013 something we usually don't feel like doing when it happens.\n\"Sometimes the emotional damage is more severe than the physical damage, and that's why you can feel so weak emotionally following vomiting, too,\" she adds.\n\"It's actually totally normal to feel out of it after vomiting; most people feel very weak for a couple of days and then they slowly return to normal. And that happens because your body \u2013 and your mind",
        "Why do babies puke so much? If it is not plausible, no. The main points here is that smooth muscle is not trainable, the function of biliary sphincters is not trainable, no one seems to have tested the effects of these interventions for long periods at sufficient dose and frequency.\nWhen we train our muscles and our bile ducts they get stronger and more efficient as this is what we are trying to achieve. In theory this makes sense but it is not always borne out by the scientific evidence.\nFor instance, the studies on the effects of massage training were only of short periods, usually between a week and a month, and the evidence suggests that the effect dissipates within a matter of months unless we do continual training throughout the lifetime. We know that smooth muscle has been found to persist for many years without much atrophy in the adult dog (Matsubara and Oka, 1985). I am of course not a muscular dystrophy suff",
        "Why does salt make everything taste better? Why do humans like it? Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain wrong. It's not actually salt that makes things taste better. You see, our brain is very important when it comes to how we taste our food.\n\nSalt might make things taste better, but our brain is way more important. It is like the boss, telling us what flavors we like and how much. When we eat something, our taste buds send a message to our brain. This message helps our brain know what the food tastes like and how much salt we should add. So, it's all about our brain!\n\nBut how does salt affect our taste buds, and how our brain understands food flavors? The first part starts with our taste buds on our tongue. There are special cells called taste buds that can sense different flavors. When we put food in our mouth, the taste buds send a message to the brain. This message",
        "Why is death irreversible? Your tissue is made of cells, which are basically tiny living things. When they die, the things they are made out of break down and disappear.\nThere is no way to undo death. Nothing will change the fact that your body has stopped working. Your heart isn\u2019t beating, you aren\u2019t moving, and you aren\u2019t breathing. You don\u2019t need to die to feel better. If you are feeling sick, talk to your doctor.\nWhat is life? You are made up of cells just like everyone else. These cells have different jobs in your body. They are your brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and more. And without these cells and their jobs, none of us could stay alive.\nYour life is a really precious thing. So cherish it. Appreciate all the things your body does to keep you healthy. And most importantly, be curious. Try to always keep learning new things.",
        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning? Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is the reason.\nDOMS is the pain muscles feel within 24 -48 hours after intense and unaccustomed strenuous exercise. This usually occurs in the days following a sudden increase in frequency, duration, or intensity of exercise.\nThere are many theories about DOMS. They all involve microscopic damage to muscle fibers. The damage, which usually involves the damage to the actin and myosin filaments, causes swelling, inflammation, and pain.\nHere is a closer look at the main theories about DOMS and what the latest research says about them. As always, let us know if you have questions or feedback.\nThe central governor and the nervous system\nAccording to this theory, DOMS is thought to occur due to central nervous system (CNS) fatigue. CNS fatigue occurs when the CNS"
