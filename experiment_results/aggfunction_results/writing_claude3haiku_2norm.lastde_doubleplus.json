This is the fundamental belief of the Gray Jedi, a faction that has long been misunderstood and overlooked within the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe Gray Jedi understand that the Force is not a binary, with good and evil as its only manifestations. Instead, they believe that the Force is a spectrum, with the light and dark sides representing the extremes.
