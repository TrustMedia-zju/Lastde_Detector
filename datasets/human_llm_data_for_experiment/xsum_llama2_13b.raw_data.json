        "Spain's Christmas lottery, known as \"El Gordo\" or \"the fat one\", is a national event. It has been going since 1812 and an estimated three-quarters of Spaniards and thousands of foreigners play each year. The odds are good - around a million people walk away with cash prizes - and El Gordo is the world's biggest lottery in financial terms. It handed out 2.5bn euros last Christmas. Unlike other lotteries, players do not choose numbers. They buy a ticket with a 5-digit number on and anyone who has that ticket when the the numbers are called - or, more accurately,sung out by schoolchildrenat a televised event in Madrid - wins a share of the prize. Because of the nature of the system, tickets in a",
        "What force does the law allow? In England and Wales, anyone can use \"reasonable\" force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. Householders are protected from prosecution as long as they act \"honestly and instinctively\" in the heat of the moment. \"Fine judgements\" over the level of force used are not expected, says the Crown Prosecution Service. What this means in practice is that someone can claim they attacked in self-defence if they genuinely believed they were in peril - even if in hindsight they were clearly wrong. Victims do not have to wait to be attacked if they are in their home and fear for themselves or others. These guidelines also apply if someone, in the spur of the moment, picks up an item to use as a weapon. The law very clearly says that a householder is not expected to weigh up the arguments",

The cabinet also backed a bill requiring any peace deal with the Palestinians to be put to a referendum. Palestinian sources have suggested peace talks, stalled since 2010, could restart next week. Some 104 long-term Palestinian prisoners will be released in four stages over a number of months, linked to progress in the peace process. In addition to the votes for and against in cabinet, there were two abstentions, a government official said.

In typical fashion, Edinburgh's pack won a penalty try, and a driving maul allowed John Hardie to plunge over. Agen's points came via two penalties from the boot of captain Clement Darbo. Stand-off Greig Tonks, who is under pressure to exert a controlling influence at first receiver with his principal rivals - Kiwi duo Phil Burleigh and Jade Te Rure - injured, kicked well in testing conditions, slotting two early penalties for the visitors.

But since taking the helm in September 2008, Mr Zardari has presided over an increasingly fragile country, a growing militant threat, a turbulent relationship with the US, an uneasy relationship with the military and nationwide flooding. Furthermore a separatist insurgency in the south-west has not eased, and both the economy and the energy situation have worsened.

One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004.

NHS leaders are now pushing for investment to allow them to repair decaying buildings, upgrade facilities and fund new plans to develop care in local communities. If central government funding is limited, they argue, the alternative is private finance. Jim Mackey who heads the financial regulator NHS Improvement, along with other health service officials, has had discussions with private financial institutions.

        "When Hans Asperger first defined autistic psychopathy in 1944, he was talking about boys. He thought no women or girls were affected by the condition. This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive. A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one. A more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one. But there is growing evidence that more girls and women have the condition than was originally thought and that it is being significantly under-diagnosed. We met Millie at home in Norfolk.

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs",
