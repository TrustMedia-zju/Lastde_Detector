Charity Action Duchenne said a new facility could improve the quality of life and lifespan of sufferers. The Welsh government has said it is working to improve services and support for those with muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe of the muscular dystrophies, according to the Action Duchenne charity. The charity said the disease, which affects mainly boys, was 100% fatal. Sufferers are diagnosed usually by the age of five and without good medical intervention they rarely live beyond their late teens and twenties, it said. Wales was the only country in the UK to screen newborn children for the condition, but screening was withdrawn at the end of November. The Welsh government said the test was no longer reliable.

The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes. That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks. \"A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,\" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year.

Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around",
        "Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey. About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production. Their concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC. The questionnaire was sent to members of the British Leafy Salad Association and British Summer Fruits,",

        "When Hans Asperger first defined autistic psychopathy in 1944, he was talking about boys. He thought no women or girls were affected by the condition. This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive. A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one. A more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one.

Royal Mail said UK letter volumes declined by 5% in the quarter with revenue down 4%. But that was in line with forecasts. UK parcel volumes were 3% higher and rose by 9% in Europe, with revenue up 2% and 8% respectively. The company said its outlook for letter and parcel volumes remained unchanged from guidance issued with its annual results in May. Royal Mail said it remained focused on cutting costs at its UK business this year. It added that, as in all previous years, its performance would be weighted to the second half of the year given the dependence on its traditionally busy Christmas parcels delivery period. Royal Mail's European parcel deliveries service, GLS, performed better than expected, the group said, largely driven by strong growth in Italy and",

Former England batsman Pietersen, 34, says \"only politics are keeping Cook in a job\" as it would be \"yet another PR disaster\" if he were to be sacked. In his Daily Telegraph column, he suggests Ian Bell as Cook's successor. Responding to Pietersen's comments, Cook told BBC Sport: \"Everyone is entitled to their view and I can't let it get to me. It is a tough job when you don't win and when you don't score runs it's tougher.\" Former England captains Michael Vaughan has called for Eoin Morgan to replace Cook as skipper, while ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott said Cook is too \"stubborn\" to quit.

After beating Leinster in last May's Pro12 final to round off a stunning 2015-16 campaign, Pat Lam's Connacht side got off to a dreadful start this season as home hammerings by Glasgow and the Ospreys were followed by a further 17-8 defeat by the Dragons. It could have been even worse for the champions as they looked set for a shock defeat by Zebre in Italy on 17 September before torrential rain led to the abandonment of the game. However, Connacht moved off the bottom of the table last weekend thanks to a 28-15 bonus-point win over fellow strugglers Edinburgh and Wilson expects Lam's squad to be fired up",

The Spaniard took over on 11 March with the team in the Premier League relegation zone for two basic reasons - they concede too many goals, and they find scoring them very difficult. Benitez's task is to make Newcastle more solid, but also increase their creativity and goal threat. At this stage of the season, with so few games left, it will be a big, tough job for him to turn all of that around.

Reality Check verdict: The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: \"Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.\" The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year. But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the",

Furthermore a separatist insurgency in the south-west has not eased, and both the economy and the energy situation have worsened. In May 2011 he had to cope with the fall-out in Pakistan of the killing by US special forces of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad.

He was speaking in Lima, Peru, where negotiators from 194 countries are heading into a second week of UN talks. They hope to agree a text that would form the basis of new global compact, to be signed in Paris next year. Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon. According to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format. \"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said. \"That, in my view, is a serious mistake.

We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more money in the hands of savers means that they have more money to buy investments (houses, shares etc) and businesses with. Shouldn't this, in the long run, drive share prices up, and house prices down?\nThat is the assumption. In practice, savers are more likely to park their money in the bank, because there is a perceived lower reward for risky investment. So if, say, a bank increases its interest rate, and savers continue to park their money in the bank, then they will lose money, while the banks will gain it.\nA rise of 0.25% means that the interest rate is 0.25% better than what it currently is.
