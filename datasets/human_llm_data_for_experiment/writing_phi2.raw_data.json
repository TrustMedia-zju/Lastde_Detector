They were huddled up in the rocks, and the enemy was combing everything over. Not a hair to be seen, except for that of the fallen Timberwolves. The Automatic Rifleman fixed the boonie hat - like the Designated Marksmans, though he had a shemagh over his mouth - before looking around for a few seconds. Nobody had passed. Dust blew over the sand, setting a better scene for the Designated Marksman. He looked over, placing a hand in the air. It closed into a fist - calling for attention from the Automatic Rifleman.

Every summer in my life that I can remember, my parents had dragged our family out to Crater Lake for our annual \"Danielson weekend of fun\" as my Mom called it. Except it wasn't fun, it was bullshit. If you've ever been to Crater Lake, or any lake for that matter, you would know that lakes are incredibly boring. I'm sure there are some things you can do for fun on a lake, like intertubing or jetskiing; however our outings mostly revolved around \"soaking up the sun\", whatever that means. One summer though, was certainly more interesting than the others. This summer was between my eight and ninth grade year, so as you could imagine, I was spanking the monkey A LOT that summer.

There are a couple of different types, and I'm not really read up on how they all work, but I'll try to explain them. Most prominent is blue magic. Blue mages are typically either elementalists or conjurers, and my sister Eleanor is the latter. She took fencing classes in college, so she uses her magic to compress the mana in the air into the solid form of a rapier. Her daughter Marie practices both fencing and kendo, but she can't use magic. Personally, I think it's because she's a latent Silver mage, like her father was. See, Silver mages generate power within their bodies, unlike other kinds who have to pull it from the environment. It manifests as a silver flame, and what it does varies immensely from one person",

Who lives in a pineapple underpants world?\nAnd the United States isn't alone. Many countries around the globe detonate dozens of small explosions each week, generating enough radioactive fallout to contaminate rain clouds.\nAs much as 40% of U.S. nuclear waste is incinerated in nuclear reactors. It's impossible to measure fallout precisely, but by some estimates, one square mile of rain could contain over 300 grams (10 ounces) of radioactive iodine-131, about 10,000 times the legally permissible annual dose.\nThe most troubling fact about these incidents is that the radiation levels don't necessarily peak in the vicinity of the nuclear explosion. Depending on prevailing weather conditions, the fallout plume can drift across oceans and continents miles from the detonation site, spreading radioactive particles even after the official threat has passed.\nIn the case of the U.S., a",

In Mathematics, place value helps us understand the value of numbers based on their position. The value and position of digits is critical in order to solve mathematical problems. Similarly, in communication, understanding the value and position of our words, tone, and mannerisms is critical in order to convey meaning effectively.\n\nFor instance, let's go back to the example of Rudeness and Politeness. In ancient times, people often relied on hand gestures to communicate their intentions. A simple \"thumbs up\" could mean either agreement or a warning, depending on the context. In",

To prove your theory, you decided to do an experiment by observing the daily activities of 100 people in your high school.

And, can personality predict which people will reach their goals and which will not?\n\"By the time you're 25, you've been living with your personality for a couple of decades. Your personality has taught you certain ways of approaching life,\" said Paul. \"Your personality shows up in your decisions, choices, and what you expect to happen.
