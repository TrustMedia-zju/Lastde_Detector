Each night he would set his alarm to 8:30am the next day . This afforded him enough time to get his morning duties out of the way and start working by 9 . In truth he would wake up at 8:25 on the dot , his body clock acutely tuned from years of routine . The setting of the alarm had become a habit , almost a ritual , as reliable as it was unnecessary . Much like the rest of each of Jon 's days inevitably proved to be . <newline> <newline> Jon got out of bed and waddled over to the bathroom . He gently splashed his face with cold water , careful not to get any on the floor . He made a quick stop at the fridge to fetch an Up & Go before settling in at his computer to browse the news websites . Everyone else was still asleep and the house was cloaked in a comfortable silence , broken only by brief staccato clacks as Jon entered his password and navigated to the appropriate URLs . <newline> <newline> Jon felt a little tired which was puzzling to him . Then again , there was less traffic than usual the day before so he got to the gym a full five minutes ahead of schedule . `` I guess it was those extra few minutes in the steam room '' he conceded . Still , he was unable to get a firm grip on his focus , eventually allowing his eyes to wander from the screen to the wall . The wall of course was terrifically plain ; a kind of off-white neutrality which was so unobtrusive that one might not register its existence despite staring right at it . Jon gazed upwards , and found the edge of the wall adorned with a freshly formed spider web . <newline> <newline> Outside the clouds shifted slightly , permitting a ray of light to peek through Jon 's window . The edge of the web glistened momentarily , revealing a solitary string of silk leading away from the dense web network and continuing down behind Jon 's PC case . He brought himself to follow its feint path , his eyes tensing as keeping track of its distinct direction became increasingly difficult . The tune to Wizard of Oz permeated through his mind - `` follow the silky-grey road '' he unconsciously muttered in sing-song . <newline> <newline> Abruptly , Jon shook his head in disbelief . `` Follow the silky-grey road ! ? '' Jon was startled . This kind of silliness was uncharacteristic to say the least . `` Unacceptable even '' he affirmed . `` Surely unacceptable ... '' he began to muse . But this was no time for contemplation , he was due to begin work shortly and he had barely begun on his breakfast drink . Jon wrote this episode off as a mere lapse of judgement . `` Forget this nonsense and get to work '' he resolved . <newline> <newline> He opened his registration sheet and began inputting his time of commencement for work . He checked the the computer clock for an exact figure . 10:43 . Wait.. what ? 10:43 . Had he forgotten about daylight savings ? He ran over to the living room where a mechanical clock hung over the couch . Panic was beginning to set in . 10:43 . `` Impossible ! What about the alarm ? '' It never went off . Jon 's eyes widened . <newline> <newline> He did n't know what this meant or what was going on , but he felt both dreadfully sick and invigoratingly excited . He began gathering his gym bag , leaving the computer glaring with news site tabs still haphazardly spread across monitor . Without confirming that he had collected all his gear , Jon jumped in the car and sped off towards the steam room .\n","1":"My eyes woke to me staring into the stars , and my head pounded . I realized almost immediately that I was lying on the ground and it was wet . I sat upwards and looked around , I was alone in the field , and I had no idea where I was . The field stretched for a couple miles in either direction , with a forest off to my left . <newline> <newline> I shook my head and felt it was pounding , `` Goddamnit , '' I whispered to myself . <newline> <newline> And then I saw the handgun off to my right , sitting neatly on top a suitcase . My heart began to beat rapidly as I tried to piece together how I got here . There was no discernible explanation , I had gotten home from work as I usually did and then hung out with some friends . There was nothing that could have happened between then and now that made me get here . <newline> <newline> That 's when I fully realized what I was dressed in , a neat suit and tie that was n't mine . I was , clearly , in a bad situation . I sat up and finally stood straight , examining the area around me . `` Alright , '' I told myself , `` let 's see if there 's anything useful here . '' I knelt down in the dirt and lifted the handgun , moving it carefully from the top of the suitcase to the grass . Then I lifted up the suitcase and tried to open it . <newline> <newline> The suitcase was normal for the most part , and it required a four digit code to open . I sighed heavily , `` What the hell ? '' <newline> <newline> I sat backwards on my hind legs and crossed my arms , that 's when I felt the paper in the suit 's breast pocket . I opened the jacket and then grabbed the envelope that neatly sat in the pocket . It was a plain white envelope and written clearly on the front was my name , *Archie Richards* . <newline> <newline> I took a deep breath , whoever dressed me in this suit and put me here had done it purposefully . But questions remained , who put me here , why , how and for what reason ? My only hope was that the letter would answer some of those questions , and that I could get the hell out of Dodge . <newline> <newline> I opened the envelope and there was only a single sheet of folded paper inside of it , after opening it up , it was clearly a letter . I opened it up and started to read . <newline> <newline> > Mr . Richards , <newline> > > I 'm sure you are wondering why you woke up lying in the middle of a field , how you got there , who put you there , and most importantly , for what reasons . It 's quite simple actually . <newline> <newline> *How could any of this be simple ? * <newline> <newline> > > My organization has selected you , based on your performance in the field . We have watched you grow among your fellow candidates and have deemed you the most qualified for our next moves . <newline> <newline> *What the hell was this guy talking about ? What other candidates ? What field ? * <newline> <newline> > > You must have no end of questions , especially now , but know that years ago you were selected to be part of this pool of candidates , based on your gene code . You may not remember it , you may not even figure it out until you reach us , but you will know in due time . When you are ready . <newline> <newline> > > You are humanity 's last , and only , hope to stop the virus . A virus that lives inside of you and will try so desperately to end the world that you know . Inside the suitcase is a tablet , notifying you of your current position and where you can go next . It is fingerprinted to you , and you alone . The suitcase also contains several dozen pill bottles , follow the directions on each bottle to the letter , or you will die . Begin with the one marked Alpha , and move through the rest as you finish each bottle . <newline> <newline> I took a deep breath , this was getting all too real . <newline> <newline> > > The suit combination is 9-3-2-7 . Remember this code , you will need it later . Once you take the first pill , travel to these coordinates , 37.2350\u00b0 N , 115.8111\u00b0 W. Speak the code you have now memorized and the following , `` Olympus will not fall by my hand . '' <newline> <newline> > > It will come clear soon enough , Archie , all of this will make sense in time . Get back to town , speak to no one , and come to us . The gun is a last resort . You are our last hope . <newline> <newline> I glanced at the gun in the dirt and then finished reading . <newline> <newline> > > We will be waiting for your arrival . <newline> <newline> There was no sign off , just an ominous symbol at the bottom of the letter of a silhouette of a mountain with an arrow piercing it . Part of me felt like I had knew the symbol , as if it plagued my dreams for years and then all of a sudden disappeared from my memories . Part of me knew what it was . <newline> <newline> I looked back at the suitcase and entered the four digit code . The suitcase clicked open and sitting neatly in several lines were thirty-four pill bottles , each of them labeled . The first , Alpha , was a drug called Benzodiazepine . I recognized the name , it was an anti-anxiety drug and it clearly said to take one per day until the bottle emptied . Looking inside there were about seven pills , one week . <newline> <newline> Part of me wanted to get up and leave , to just forget about everything that had just happened , but part of me wanted to do what the letter said . Part of me knew that I *had* to do what the letter said , so I grabbed the pill bottle , opened it , and swallowed one of the pills . <newline> <newline> `` Good thing I do n't need water , '' I murmured as the pill went down and I turned back to the suitcase . The tablet was attached to the back of the top of it , and as I grabbed it , I placed my thumb on the home button . <newline> <newline> It lit up immediately and started the sequence , but unlike an ordinary tablet , it had a new startup screen . The words slid across the front and my heart skipped a beat . <newline> <newline> **Welcome Back Olympian Rho . It has been seventeen years , eight months , and nineteen days since your last login . ** <newline> <newline> I stared at the startup screen until the words disappeared <newline> <newline> `` Olympian Rho , '' I whispered and in a flash a memory came back to me . <newline> <newline> I was just a kid , a young orphaned teenager when I agreed to the program , a program that gave me food , a job , a home , and everything I needed to survive . Chosen out of the millions who applied , a small sixteen year old Archie became an Olympian . A man who would be under surveillance until the time came , until one of the twenty-four Olympians was chosen to finish what Olympus had started . <newline> <newline> Olympus , the organization that gave Archia a chance . The organization that created Olympian Rho . <newline> <newline> I snapped back into reality as a a view of my current location came up on the map . I was about six miles west of a small town just inside New York . I lived in New Jersey , how I ended up here was still a question in the air . But I had to , I knew , I needed to get to the coordinates . <newline> <newline> I did n't remember how or why I was important to Olympus , but I knew that I signed up for a reason , and it would eventually all come back to me . <newline> <newline> I was intent on doing what I needed to . So I grabbed the gun , shut the suitcase , and started to walk . I would do what I needed to , for the good of humanity . I would be the Olympian I needed to be . <newline> <newline> _____ <newline> <newline> *Great prompt !

In the three hundred years since the Village on the Brook had been founded by their sires , none had yet compared to the suppleness of his cured skins , nor the enduring boots and cloaks that were born from the harvest of his labor . And while many a Tanner were crotchety , unpleasant folk-and really , who could blame them , what with the perfume of their trade forcing them to the outskirts of the Village on the Brook-Rein Tanner was a polite , if quite sort of young man . The kind that was forgot in the corner of the room , watching as others laughed and jibbed , but nearly always friendly enough when finally noticed , and made an effort more than most to smell as little of the vats as he could . <newline> <newline> It was the gospel truth that though he was polite , he did n't seek the attention or intention of any man-a fit trait for his trade-and none of any woman , save that of Joanna Thatcher . Her dark , flaxen lined hair was like gossamer in his heart , the light of her smile the north star of his dreams , which themselves were tinted the color of her evergreen eyes . <newline> <newline> Oft he would sit and wait by the tanning vats just as the last dim light of day cast it 's gleam off the steam rising from them , and more often than not she would come , and he would glimpse her for a brief moment as she plunged fearlessly into the heart of the woods to chase her own love , the Fae . <newline> <newline> The Fae were a mighty , wild folk that dwelt in desolate lands such as the Village on the Brook . They were as liable to cruelty as kindness , to pain as comfort , and the difference was little seen to them . To her they were freedom and a clever madness , and so she would depart in the grey of the morn and the twilight of evening when they 're closest to Man , and pursue them as the relentless hunter pursues a buck . Oft she came back , pale , breathless , her eyes like a quarried dog , and Tanner glimpsed her before she passed from sight into the thicket . Sometimes she would return with tears , and he knew that she 'd been kissed , or struck , or both , and his heart hurt in different ways . <newline> <newline> Once as she came back , a scar over eyes filled with the ruin of defeat , he felt his heart stop within him . It remained so as he followed her home , a few steps behind so that she never saw nor heard him . She walked slowly back into her house , a small , well thatched hut within view of the Brook . A few moments later , he reached the door , and as if possessed , knocked upon it and asked for her hand . <newline> <newline> She refused , yet , he persisted . Once a night for weeks he returned , asking the same simple answer , and receiving the same simple reply . As she made her way into the forest one evening , Rein ran to meet her . She met him cooly , yet her eyes contained something akin to compassion .\n","4":"I have an interesting friend , see . Or , at least that \u2019 s what I \u2019 m led to believe . I don \u2019 t see him often \u2014 he \u2019 s only in town every couple of months \u2014 and when he is , he tends to forget to tell me he \u2019 s around . But , we keep in touch , somewhat . In fact , I don \u2019 t know if I can necessarily call him a friend . Our lives brush by every so often , sometimes aligning for a rare day or two , but then he \u2019 s off again , back to his \u201c business \u201d . He never has told me what that business is . The new clothes and generous wallet tells me it \u2019 s going well . People treat him like he \u2019 s important , and everything he says has finality to it . He gets what he wants , does what he wants , and those around him flock to him for it . I guess that \u2019 s why I still try to know him . <newline> <newline> People started coming to me about him , asking if I can let them speak to him . I don \u2019 t know how they find me . Usually , it happens when I \u2019 m on my own walking down the street , but there \u2019 s been a few times they \u2019 ve come to my apartment door , knocking incessantly . I \u2019 ve never put up a fuss about it . Typically , I just hand over his cell number , and *whoosh* , they \u2019 re on their way in their black leather or combat suit or nearly nothing at all . Not one has been dressed like an average , everyday person , like they \u2019 re *trying* to stick out in a crowd , forsaking any sense of taste for the Rule of Cool . <newline> <newline> I tried not to question any of it . I really did . That is , till one of them shot me in the head . <newline> <newline> I was having a bad day . A really bad day . The-only-pair-of-socks-you-have-left-are-slightly-wet kind of bad day . The-landlady-yelled-at-you-for-being-late-on-rent-again bad , bad day . And then came one . I saw him a mile away , his gold jacket and flame-decaled biker helmet being the sorest of all thumbs in the crowd ahead . I veered into the nearest alley , intending to circumnavigate him , but he came striding in right behind me , like he knew exactly where I was going . <newline> <newline> I wheeled around , told him to bug off , I \u2019 m not in the mood . Ask someone else , wouldya . <newline> <newline> I kept yelling at him , and he just stood and stared , the helmet impassive . He didn \u2019 t say a word . In fact , they never talked . I just *knew* what they wanted , and that \u2019 s why I gave them the number . I never seemed to realize it till now , but for that one day , I \u2019 d had enough . <newline> <newline> After five minutes of me refusing to comply , he raised a gun and shot me square in the forehead . I know he did , because I felt it . It wasn \u2019 t painful , just shocking . All I remember was my head swinging back , my legs giving out , and my body hitting the pavement before it all went dark . <newline> <newline> I woke up in my bed , right as rain . The bathroom mirror confirmed it . No damage to my face , no brains blown out the back of my head . Not even a bruise from falling . Maybe a dream ? No , it was too real . Much too real . <newline> <newline> I checked my calendar , then my phone . It was still the same day , but morning again . <newline> <newline> The day went on , but I remained confused . I ate breakfast , made sure to dry some socks this time , and went to work again . Nothing out of the ordinary occurred , and I left when my shift was over . I left at the same time , went down the same street , and passed the same people . <newline> <newline> Then , again , there was bike-helmet-guy . I veered into the alley again , and he followed . <newline> <newline> This time I didn \u2019 t say a word and only returned the stare . He didn \u2019 t wait as long as last time . The gun rose , his finger tensed , and he pulled the trigger . <newline> <newline> Nothing happened . There was no sharp blast , no slam to the face , no darkness . The gun didn \u2019 t even fire . <newline> <newline> I watched him pull the trigger again , and then again , and then again . Nothing . He looked the gun over , shaking his head . He pointed it to my side . BANG . The bullet fired and dug itself into the brickwork of the building . *That* made me jump , my hair standing on end as every flight instinct in my bones begged me to run for it . <newline> <newline> I held my ground , though , as he continued to mess with the gun . He \u2019 d point at me , fail to fire , then shoot the wall again . This happened three more times . All the while , it dawned on me . This guy , this\u2026 off brand biker gang member . He couldn \u2019 t attack me . No matter how hard he tried , how much he wanted me dead , it was as if the very fabric of reality refused it . <newline> <newline> As he approached and started to swing his fists at my head in frustration , his knuckles forced to a stop only inches from my skull every time , I started to consider the possibilities of this . They always came alone . They were always dressed out of the norm . They knew where I was at all times . They never spoke , and all they wanted was the number for a person much more interesting than me . One had managed to kill me , but now he couldn \u2019 t even touch me . What did it even mean ? Was I so important to these odd people that they\u2026 <newline> <newline> Wait . <newline> <newline> No . <newline> <newline> Oh . <newline> <newline> Oh . My . God . <newline> <newline> <newline> ( Second part is in my reply . ) <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","5":"Chaos King laughed maniacally , which was to be expected . <newline> <newline> `` You thought you had me figured out , did you ? Thought I was going for the Bavarian Crown Jewels ? Tried to head me off ? Ahahaha ! ! You wasted your time , *hero . * And look at all I 've accomplished in your absence !

You think you can work out my plans , thwart me , comprehend me ! '' His voice lowered ominously . `` You never understand . Kid , it 's not the villains with an agenda you need to worry about . You can do your little dance with them and they 'll play along . The ones you should worry about are those of us who zig when you zag . Who tango during your waltz .

See the bombs on the fourth and fifth supports ? They 're set to blow in five ... no , four minutes . Better get a move on , kid ! I 'll see myself out while you 're at it . '' <newline> <newline> I sighed . `` Chaos , it is n't is heroes with an agenda you need to worry about . You can anticipate them . Understand them . Manipulate them . The ones you need to worry about are those of us without an agenda . Those of us who just like beating people to a pulp without going to jail for it .

''\n","6":"I sit in the caf\u00e9 sipping my hot chocolate calmly . My entire body aches from running for so long . I look to the window keeping alert . I would have to leave soon and head to the train station ; Charlie was the smartest cop that I knew and in all likelihood he was already on my trail . I throw out the cup and grab my backpack ready to go . I look at the train time schedule once I get to the station and deliberate my destination . The secret to being on the run was never having a set plan . If I didn \u2019 t know where I was going , neither would anyone else . I decide to head upstate towards the countryside ; although farming communities were often tightly knit , there were fewer cops and they seemed to be less suspicious than those in the city . I sit on the train and read a magazine . I sense someone sit next to me but I \u2019 m too tired to care . I imagine a cozy queen sized bed with tons of pillows that I have to just myself and yawn . <newline> <newline> The person next to me chuckles and exclaims , \u201c Crime is tiring , huh ? \u201d <newline> <newline> I look up worriedly to see Charlie sitting next to me . He snaps a set of handcuffs one on my wrist and one on the seat . I look around fearfully and he laughs . <newline> <newline> \u201c There is no one here . I \u2019 m not even on duty . We \u2019 ll get off at the first stop and I \u2019 ll call in some back up , \u201d he says in an amused tone . <newline> <newline> I roll my eyes , \u201c Please Charlie , you have to let me go , \u201d I plead . <newline> <newline> He looks at me disgusted , \u201c You are a murderer , you deserve to be punished , \u201d he says . <newline> <newline> I shake my head frustrated ; I couldn \u2019 t tell him the truth because he would never believe it . I imagine my \u201c victim \u2019 s \u201d face . She has short black hair and rosy cheeks , I \u2019 m sure she was happy wherever she was . She was only nineteen when she murdered Charlie . After his death , I received a small button in the mail which said , \u201c Press to go back in time \u201d . I pressed it and when she was born , I stole her from the hospital and I left her at a random police station in South Carolina . I figured that she would be put in the foster care system and adopted . I hoped she \u2019 d have a better chance with new parents and at the very least I figured that dropping her off so far away would protect Charlie . I couldn \u2019 t tell anyone or she would be tracked down and returned to her parents doomed to make the same mistakes . Everyone assumed I murdered the baby because she was still missing after all this time and while it sucked , the first time losing Charlie was painful enough ; I wasn \u2019 t going to let it happen again . <newline> <newline> I look at Charlie and then close my eyes ; I was tired of running . <newline> <newline> \u201c Why did you do it ? \u201d he asks quietly . <newline> <newline> I laugh and answer , \u201c She \u2019 s not dead . She \u2019 s just adopted. \u201d <newline> <newline> He was never going to believe a word out of my mouth . The News had painted me as a maniacal baby killer and my story wasn \u2019 t exactly the most rational . <newline> <newline> \u201c Where is she ? \u201d he asks picking up my backpack and beginning to go through it . I blush wondering what he \u2019 ll pull out . <newline> <newline> I shake my head , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter , \u201d I reply as he pulls out my scrapbook . <newline> <newline> \u2018 Well this was going to be interesting \u2019 I think as he begins to flip through the pages . <newline> <newline> He wears a puzzled face and says , \u201c You look very nice in these wedding pictures , what happened to your husband ? \u201d <newline> <newline> I smile ; of course Charlie would see a picture of himself and think it was someone else . <newline> <newline> \u201c He died , \u201d I say quietly looking at Charlie \u2019 s young inquisitive face focused on my scrapbook . <newline> <newline> He closes the book and puts it back in my bag , \u201c I \u2019 m sorry for your loss . Hopefully you \u2019 ll be able to plead insanity or land in an institution where you can get proper help to cope. \u201d <newline> <newline> I begin to feel tears in my eyes and look at the handcuff , \u201c Can I go to the bathroom ? \u201d I ask . <newline> <newline> Charlie shakes his head and replies , \u201c Nope. \u201d <newline> <newline> He was a good cop and wasn \u2019 t easily fooled . Escaping in the bathroom would be a disgrace for him ; I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 d ever forgive himself for that mistake . I wipe my eyes with my free hand and he hands me a tissue . Even when dealing with what he believed was a murderer , he was never cruel . I begin to hyperventilate with worry and he looks at me concerned . <newline> <newline> \u201c Take a deep breath and just relax . Everything is going to be okay , \u201d he says softly . <newline> <newline> Charlie had anxiety too and sympathized with anyone who suffered through it as well . I cough and try to distract myself by thinking of good memories . <newline> <newline> \u201c Can I tie up my hair ? \u201d I ask quietly as my tears act as glue between my hair and my face . He looks at me suspiciously and sighs before tying up my hair himself . <newline> <newline> I chuckle , \u201c You must hate me , \u201d I say . <newline> <newline> He shakes his head and replies , \u201c You \u2019 re just sick . You \u2019 re not evil. \u201d <newline> <newline> He unlocks the handcuff and grabs my arm tightly . He escorts me off the train and we head to the front of the station . He calls for back up on his cell phone and they arrive within fifteen minutes . A rookie officer puts me in real handcuffs and reads me my rights before leading me to his squad car . I get the feeling that he is very new to the squad from how loose the handcuffs are . <newline> <newline> I lean against the car tiredly and I hear , \u201c Officer Wilds ! \u201d <newline> <newline> The rookie looks at me curiously and tells me to wait before running over to the older officer . I look around and see that Charlie is being interviewed by two other officers and a lieutenant talking to the rookie . I walk to the front of the car and slip out of the extremely loose handcuffs . I grab my backpack and slip away into an alley way with a smile . I was still tired but at least I wouldn \u2019 t be sleeping in a cell . <newline>\n","7":"\u201c Wake up , Jerry. \u201d <newline> <newline> The speakers lining the walls of Jerry 's bedroom , as well as the entire inside of the house , blared to life with a dull hum . Jerry pulled the covers over his eyes as the ceiling fan 's light bulbs buzzed on .

I moved silently but quickly to ensure she didn \u2019 t see what I was doing . In a silent flash my left sock was off and the number one appeared over my head . Finally , I was no longer at zero .

Ragged romance novels and cheap paperback mystery novels were crammed haphazardly on the shelves . The books had always been for sale ; they were a fixture in the Coffee Shoppe , much like the strange owner , who opened when he rolled out of bed , closed when he got tired , and would tell anyone who would listen how he thought that the universe was created specifically for jackrabbits , and were n't we all lucky we humans got to tag along for the ride . <newline> <newline> <newline> The Coffee Shoppe had been there a week from yesterday , or forever , depending on who you asked . No matter how long the business had been there , the Coffee Shoppe was both old and new at the same time . No matter . The Reading Room of the Coffee Shoppe was the greatest room in the entire town , maybe even the entire state . Hundreds of people ( all saying that they had heard about the grand opening last week ) came to try out the wingback chairs that seemed to approach comfort from the other side- the longer one sat in the chair , the more comfortable they became . The owner was consistently kicking people out at closing , pushing them from `` The Comfy Chairs '' into the cold night . <newline> <newline> <newline> But the bookcases , ah , the bookcases . These towering behemoths carried the real reason everyone came to the Coffee Shoppe . The books covered a wide range of genres , from the sci-fi section with it 's original copies of the scripts from the likes of Star Wars and Star Trek : Next Generation , to the classics , such as William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens . The Coffee Shoppe books , however , were different . It seems that the owner 's ancestors were avid illustrators of books , as each and every book was hand illuminated , and had the autograph of the author on the title page . <newline> <newline> <newline> So it seemed to be the running joke : why the hell did Dickens and Shakespeare share the same room , or even the same building as a bunch immovable trashy romance novels and mystery paperbacks ? <newline> <newline> <newline> < hr > <newline> <newline> <newline> It had been a rather lousy day . I had a horrible math class ; the kind where the numbers just dance around inside your head and laugh at you , and some asshat had stolen my copy of *Great Expectations* . So , I was of course , sitting in one of the Coffee Shoppe 's many comfortable chairs , sipping a rather amazing chai tea latte . The chai tea latte had a napkin-wrap around it , and a no-spill lid that I had made myself , to protect the glorious illustrations on *Great Expectations* . The book was quite excellent , the story and irony of Pip 's rise seemed to be a metaphorical salve for my horrible day ( though , the chai and the chair might have helped a little ) . No one else was in the Coffee Shoppe , save me and the owner , who was polishing what looked like a glass coffee maker that was made while on acid . Half an hour passed , and I went to get another chai , leaving Dickens on one of the many small tables scattered around the Reading Room . <newline> <newline> When I got back , another book was on top of *Great Expectations* . I flipped it over , revealing *Love 's Savage Secret* ? <newline> <newline> My mind raced . Everyone in town had been trying for almost a week to get the cheap romances off the back shelf , and here one had just fallen into my lap . I went back to the back bookshelf , and indeed , one book was missing . <newline> <newline> I raced to the front of the shop , my eyes wide with excitement . <newline> <newline> `` Doctor Parzival ! '' <newline> <newline> His head jerked up from under the counter , a tray of pastries in his hand , `` Yes , what do you want ? I 'm very busy , you know , '' he said impatiently , raising a tray of chocolate croissants . <newline> <newline> I held up the book , `` I pulled one of the romances off the back shelf . '' <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> Doctor Parzival did n't move his blue-grey eyes from the book I held in my hands . <newline> <newline> `` Doctor Parzival ? '' I asked timidly , worried that I had broken some sort of Coffee Shoppe Code , `` Is something wrong ? '' <newline> <newline> He seemed to snap out of it , shaking his head quickly , and moving towards the front windows . The blinds came down with a snap , and the plastic `` Closed '' sign was flipped . I suddenly became aware of just how alone the both of us were in the now dark coffee shop . Doctor Parzival managed to get a candle lit after a few tries , but the candle was a tallow candle , and did n't do much to chase away the shadows . It did , however , slightly illuminate the Doctor 's face . <newline> <newline> `` Come child , sit . Let me tell you about L-Space .

I did n't know that no one else could see it . It was so blatantly *there* that I thought it was obvious to everyone around me , too . I remember pointing it out with my uncle , my Mom 's younger brother and drug addict who used to come over and try to bum money off my parents . I could see it , pulsing there , under his shirt , and when I tried to poke it , and told my Mom that it was kind of squishy , everyone in the room suddenly got really serious . My uncle left , in a hurry , and we did n't see him for a while after that . <newline> <newline> That was about when I met Ron , the child psychologist , and his sweater vests and shitty cologne . My Mom took me once a week for about six months , and sat in the reception area of his house , read old Reader 's Digests , and smoked . You could do that back then . <newline> <newline> Ron had a knot , too , but he asked so many questions about them and what I saw and how I saw it , that I figured out right away that it was a problem with a capital P if I did . I do n't know what he expected . No kid wants to be isolated , so I lied , like almost every kid lies when forced to stand out . After a while , he got tired of the lying and just gave up , I think , because we went less and less often , and he got more and more distracted each time . He sure liked my Mom , though . <newline> <newline> The first one I unravelled was my girlfriend 's knot in High School . Hers was kind of new and we did it on a Saturday when we were just hanging out in my room , fooling around . She wanted to kiss and stuff and to be honest , I really wanted to with her , but I also wanted to play with the knot she had because it was so new that it almost had a kind of glow about it . I could see it right through her shirt . I know she thought I was working up to taking her bra off and I 'm pretty sure she got a bit frustrated , but when I started pulling it apart , I just could n't stop . I had to see what was at the centre . It was an obsession . What I saw there scared me , and I know she saw my fear in my face , because she got up really quickly and crossed her hands over her stomach . I tried to get her back on the bed to make out some more , this time for real , but she left and we were n't boyfriend girlfriend after that . I 'm kind of glad , though , because of what her Dad did to her . That was n't right . <newline> <newline> After a few more incidences like that , I just stopped looking . I did n't need to see everyone 's sin writ large to realize they were sinners . The knot was proof enough after a while , and that 's just how I liked it . I did n't want the nightmares , any more . <newline> <newline> But Ophelia was different right from the start . She had one , and normally I steered clear of people with one , but she was like a ray of light with everything she did . She worked at the local drug store , and she was a year older than I was , wiser by far , and had that old-world look in her eyes . After talking with her at the coffee shop , I could n't help but feel I knew her from somewhere , and so I asked if I was familiar . No . Could I be ? She laughed , and that laugh was like rain drops on glass to me . I could listen to it for days . The coffee turned into lunch and into a movie and then her in my bed the next morning . It never really stopped after that . <newline> <newline> Two years later , we got married , and in that entire time , I can honestly say I was never once curious about what was in the knot . I did n't care . I loved her , she loved me , and we were happy . As the photo albums started to fill with pictures and meaning , we built and built and built and that edifice started to have a shape of its own . I liked us . We were really something . We did n't just fit , our families fit , and our pets fit , and pretty soon Jessie and Sawyer fit , and our little maelstrom was complete . I was happier at that moment , which was yesterday , than at any time in my life . I felt guilty I was so happy , like I was stealing it from someone else . <newline> <newline> Today , though , her knot was different when I woke up . Bigger , darker , moist and honestly startling . I could see it seeping through her hoody , even if she could n't . I could feel the ache coming off of it in waves . I tried to avoid it , I really did , but as she walked past me in the hallway on the way to the bathroom and gave me that sideways kiss on the edge of my mouth she does , I could feel it brush my arm . It just felt wrong . I ca n't put a word on it , but it was repugnant , as if it should have burned me , but did n't . I could see it moving with her motion as she washed the dishes , and when she tucked the kids into bed . It was like a black sore on her stomach in the bath tub when I read to her and played with her until she came . I almost could n't finish her off with it bobbing and tensing just above my hand . <newline> <newline> I know what I expected : abuse . Something long ago , old and dessicated , suddenly given new life because it was revisited . Father ? Grandfather ? The only way to know was to unravel it , but I had n't done that in years . Whatever it was , it was newly reborn and that was something I could n't ignore . <newline> <newline> I started pulling it apart when she was asleep . String by string , under and over , through and back , and it was massive . I felt like a thief or a rapist and a couple of times I stopped myself , hands shaking and sweating profusely , wondering what the hell I was doing . Do n't fuck with it , I said to myself . This is good , really good . You 're going to screw it all up and wreck this beautiful us . I imagined all the ways that my happiness could self destruct , over and over , but it was beyond control by that point . <newline> <newline> A half an hour later , the immense skein was free and I could see it . The small white hands around her throat , the tendons taut as the grip got tighter and tighter . The panic in her eyes as she realized death was coming . The kicking and struggling . The near escape as she caught some purchase and got some leverage , but then the inevitable pressure of that awful strength . I could feel terror and pleasure both from her , as the life leaked out in slow , strangled gasps , smaller and smaller until it was punctuated at the end by a truly awful silence . I saw her face mirrored on itself , grinning in death . <newline> <newline> It was my sobs that woke her up . She rolled over and threw her arm around me , spooning me from behind , and nuzzled my ear , comforting . <newline> <newline> `` You know , you should have just asked . `` , she whispered . I could n't talk , and she just let the silence linger and fester for a while because she was patient , if nothing else . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going to happen to us ? `` , I choked out , my voice a mess of gravel and tears . I started to sob , again . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't know . My kind never really settles down , but I guess we 'll talk about that after breakfast . It 's Saturday , and I can get the kids up early and take them to my Mom 's . They wo n't get in the way and we can have a good talk . You know what ? I 'm kind of relieved you know . '' She sounded almost exuberant , so I believed her . <newline> <newline> `` What are you ? `` , I said , rolling over to confront her . <newline> <newline> `` A hunter . `` , she replied matter of factly , as I stared back into my own face , grinning .\n","11":"We had no choice . <newline> <newline> We were an ancient race . We saw Galaxies form and be consumed , we saw species rise and fall under the weight of their own will to survive , we saw entire universes begin and end ... But we never saw them coming . <newline> <newline> Our species had reached enlightenment eons ago , from then on we traveled the multiverse helping species advance to what we knew to be the enlightenment we achieved . We spent millennial nurturing , protecting and teaching them . Some were accepting , trying to reach the high goals we set for them . Others were insidious , using our eternal knowledge only to further their own agenda . All , unfortunately , perished . Some failing the test of evolution and dying out while others had to be eradicated lest they pose a threat to other species . <newline> <newline> The Kariir were the best and brightest . They learnt , grew , practiced what we preached and we kept giving them more ; information , wealth , they never had enough . Yet somehow , they never attained enlightenment . We should have know . Maybe it was our desperation , finally having a species grow so fast and be so thirsty for knowledge . Perhaps we were too excited after the countless failures that we did n't see the signs . Perhaps they were too cunning even for us . <newline> <newline> As our cities fell by our own knowledge , as our vast system crumbled , we could only watch with horror as malformed versions of our own creations consumed us . It had not been knowledge they looked for , but power . They had not reached enlightenment not because they could n't , but because they did n't want to . As even our eons old strongholds fell and we were pushed back to the single planet of our origination , our council met in desperation . It was agreed . We had no choice . <newline> <newline> A single ship was sent to the quarantine zone . A small solar system surrounded by a field that blocked all communication and all detection , from inside and out , to all eyes except our own . Inside this zone was the most deadly disease we had ever come across . With just bare levels of consciousness , this parasite burrowed into a host planet , sucking it dry faster than any species in know existence . It called itself `` humans '' and upon first sighting had immediately been classified as the most dangerous plague ever to have been discovered over the know multiverse . In the time it took a regular species to develop it 's first language , this species grew into a full fledged civilization , attained near super-light travel and annihilated itself a hundred times over . They were quick to learn , violent and ruthless . Although a ( barely ) sentient species , they were classified as a plague due to the level of damage they could cause to planets should they escape the one they inhabited . With no regard for life , the only thing keeping them in check was the availability of only one planet they could devour . Should they spread , all necessity to keep their planet alive would be gone and entire universes could be lost . <newline> <newline> We had no choice . The ship docked at the planet . <newline> <newline> As with all plagues , less exposure was better . The crew of that ship knew what the signed up for . They were never seen again , doomed to spend the rest of their miserable lives being tested in all manner of horrific ways . From then on , we just nudged the humans in the right direction . We phased all remaining friendly systems with sentient life out of the humans observable reality for what was a mere heartbeat for our species and when we returned , the galaxy that was once full of life , even Kariir life , was gone . An entire universe was but a collection of husks of dead planets floating in a void . We survived . All was good for us . Or so we 'd like to believe . <newline> <newline> But we know , somewhere out there , life is being ended faster than it can begin . Somewhere out there , a species is building it 's first radio transmitter only to be descended upon by a plague . Enslaved , raped , tortured ; their world turned to ash . We had won the war , but lost so many species in the process . <newline> <newline> We tell ourselves we had no choice , but we chose us over them . All of them . We 'd doomed ourselves to a lonely existence , being the only race immune to the disease spreading across the cosmos . <newline> <newline> Humans . <newline> <newline> We had a choice , but we chose us .\n","12":"\u201c What is that ? \u201d <newline> <newline> As the world looked on , those were the last words spoken by the crew of Apollo 11 . <newline> <newline> Or so I thought . <newline> <newline> Commander Grace , our greatest astronaut , was renowned for her ability to remain freakishly calm under any type of situation imaginable . Stone Cold Grace : she was the epitome of stoic , a natural leader who inspired a nation to build towards the stars . <newline> <newline> So when she spoke those words , unmistakably afraid , the world was scared . I remember sitting in front of the television when it happened . My father was a retired NASA administrator , and I will never forget the look of fear etched into his face as the signal from the moon went dark . The phone rang twenty seconds after . I watched as his face swam with a torrent of emotions ; fear , anger , denial , resignation . Then he simply said \u201c I understand \u201d and hung up . After hugging my mother and I , he walked out the door and for the next twenty years hardly ever left his office at NASA . <newline> <newline> Not surprising , then , when I did everything I could to make sure I followed in his footsteps . I studied , trained , neglected myself socially , all to ensure I got up there . <newline> <newline> To the darkness . <newline> <newline> There were thousands of us . The last transmission from Commander Grace influenced an entire generation of astronauts . We all wanted to know what made Stone Cold Grace afraid . I saw so many burn out of the program . The nation 's best and brightest reduced to a quibbling pile of frayed nerves and broken bodies . I lost friends , lovers . But the call of the darkness was too enticing . <newline> <newline> When I got the call , the one I had been waiting for ever since the Last Transmission darkened the world , I considered myself lucky . Fortunate . I had been chosen to represent the entire human race in our quest to bring those brave souls back home . <newline> <newline> I learned all too quickly that bringing the crew of Apollo 11 back was the company line , fed to the masses to instill a sense of national pride . To get investors to sign the cheques . <newline> <newline> I had seen my Father a handful of times since the Last Transmission . My memories of him during those years are fleeting : glimpses of his harried face through the crack of my bedroom door when he thought I was asleep , his cracked hands running through his thinning hair as he and my mother argued in the kitchen . He was a ghost . I had an idea of who he was , but the reality of him slipped through my fingers like sand . <newline> <newline> When they brought me into NASA , I was called straight into his office . We stood there looking at each other in silence for what felt like a lifetime , the years of pain and neglect hanging in the air between us . I wanted to rage , to scream , to beat upon his chest while begging for answers . Where had he been ? What was said to him on that phone call that threw him into the back hole ? <newline> <newline> I could tell he was conflicted . Torn between the man loyal to NASA , to the nation , and the man who cradled my screaming body in his hands when I was born . My father . <newline> <newline> He was the first to speak . <newline> <newline> \u201c Please son , sit down \u201d . <newline> <newline> *Son* . Despite my resentment , it was all I could do to run into his arms . <newline> <newline> As I sat down in front of his desk , he hesitated for a moment . I saw then in his eyes the toll his burdens had taken on him . The strong , virile man I remembered had been reduced to a withered , strung out shell . There had been whispers of NASA \u2019 s failures after Apollo 11 , but like Commander Grace , the ill-fated space program had been on radio silence , buried in a shroud of secrecy as the world continued to wonder what had happened on the moon that day . Were those failures because of my Father ? What had he and NASA been doing all this time ? <newline> <newline> He shook his head and it broke the trance between us . He gathered his breath and began the conversation that would forever change my life . <newline> <newline> \u201c You have been selected as the Commander for Apollo 19. \u201d Gone was any hint of fatherly tenderness . Here before me was the man of NASA , the man who had walked out of the house and out of my life . I struggled not to break down under the knowledge that there had been seven secret Apollo missions . <newline> <newline> \u201c What the world knows as \u2018 The Last Transmission \u2019 from Commander Grace was incomplete . For reasons that will soon become apparent , NASA cut off the public broadcast two minutes before Commander Grace 's final moments. \u201d Here he stops , and takes a deep breath . I am trying to quell the millions of questions burning through my brain . <newline> <newline> \u201c I have sat in this chair seven times telling every Commander that came before what I am telling you , and seven times I have been wrong . We are under the strictest possible orders not to show you those last two minutes . No human being other than myself and the group of people working on Apollo 11 has ever seen it . I would be dragged in front of a wall and shot if they knew what I was about to do . But you are not like the other Commanders . They failed because they did n't *know* . Their bodies litter the surface of our moon because they did n't *see* . You are my son , and you will not die like the others. \u201d <newline> <newline> Before I could say anything , he reached down and pressed a button on one of the many remotes littering his desk . A projector slid down from the ceiling . He handed me a pair of headphones . As I placed them over my ears a overwhelming sense of dread poured down my back and sent a shiver throughout my body . I knew whatever I was about to see would change me forever . I looked to my Father . He nodded and placed a hand on my shoulder . <newline> <newline> It was a small comfort . <newline> <newline> The screaming . That is what I remember most as I sit here , strapped in beside the world 's greatest soldiers . Whatever sickness I felt when we heard the fear in Stone Cold Grace 's voice was nothing compared to the sickly wet sound of her screams . What we face now , on that lunar surface , is something the world is not ready for . As I look out into the darkness , I wonder upon the horrors and weep . Wish me well , dear Father , and pray if I do n't come back , nothing else does .\n","13":"Wake up in the morning feeling like lewis black . <newline> <newline> Slap my roommate , I 'm out the door , I 'm gon na hit the city . <newline> <newline> Before I leave put on my swag shirt , I wan na look douchey <newline> <newline> Cause when I leave for the day , I ai n't being nice <newline> <newline> . <newline> <newline> I 'm talking calling nice women hoes , hoes <newline> <newline> Making fun of all their clothes , clothes <newline> <newline> Nobody blowing up my phone , phone <newline> <newline> Fist pumping , yelling at the starbucks clerk , clerk <newline> <newline> Pulling up to my work , work <newline> <newline> Trying to get a little bit cooooooooocky <newline> <newline> . <newline> <newline> Do n't stop make it awkward <newline> <newline> People blow my mood uuuuup <newline> <newline> Tonight , I'mma be rude <newline> <newline> 'Til I get spit in my foooood <newline> <newline> Tick tock , on the clock <newline> <newline> But the party do n't stop , no oh oh oh oh <newline> <newline> oh oh oh oh <newline> <newline> . <newline> <newline> Now I 'm in a world , that got plenty of hate , hate <newline> <newline> And got no money in my pocket , but I already got stood up by my date , date <newline> <newline> And now my life is real sad , sad <newline> <newline> But I keep going til I trip someone on the curb unless they acting all bad <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","14":"I can barely remember anything after it happened , let alone before it . <newline> <newline> Noise . Lots of noise . <newline> <newline> Screaming . <newline> <newline> My devastation . <newline> <newline> Arms around me , a shushing , a sweet voice . Maybe that of my friend . <newline> <newline> My sons , my daughters , my wife- all dead . <newline> <newline> I can not very much recall the rest , as it all goes by in a blur within my forever damaged mind . I lived a normal life , I assume , grieving like any father and widower would . The rest I learned from my journals- that my family was slaughtered by some masked serial killer , that my dear friend had begun to come to my home daily to comfort me and to ensure that I was alright . <newline> <newline> I , however , vividly remember the moment I slipped . I was in a restaurant with her- my friend- when I suddenly saw that masked killer , responsible for tearing nearly everything I loved from me . In that moment , I lost it all , and my mind fragmented , never to be fully repaired . <newline> <newline> Still , bits and pieces of memory come back to me- particularly her voice , trying to coax me from my incessant sobbing . I knew not what I was weeping for , merely that I had an all-consuming sense of loss and devastation . <newline> <newline> However , with my friend 's care , I got better . I moved on , remembering more and more , acting normal again . Feeling *happy* again ! Oh , how I can remember falling in love with that wonderful friend , as she cared for me so dearly and brought me out of the abyss . In fact , she fell for me too . <newline> <newline> Now I am glad , married again with a darling son and daughter , and though I will never be the same person I was before the traumatizing event , I am jovial merely to live the life I live with my dearly beloved family . <newline> <newline> Whenever I see a picture of what I had before , though- my sons and daughters and previous wife- I still grieve , as I forget them . Every picture and memory of them is as if looking at a stranger 's family , a stranger 's life . Each letter I wrote them , each video taken , every single remembrance- relics of a life another man lived within my body . <newline> <newline> They died twice- within the world and within my memory . <newline> <newline> And for those deaths , I still grieve .\n","15":"I opened the door and stepped into my apartment . Kicking off my shoes , I reached for the lights , flicking them on without looking . I emptied my pockets onto the small table near the door , and headed for the couch . It had been a long day , and I really just needed to zone out for a while . I stood at the end of the couch , and then let myself fall onto its inviting cushions . <newline> <newline> `` Ow ! What the shit ? '' I cried . <newline> <newline> I pushed myself up . The cushion had n't been very cushy . In fact , it had been hard , making a metallic clinking when you hit it , like it was filed with small bits of metal . I grabbed the cushion and turned it so the zipper was facing me . It was liking moving a slab of concrete . And still , a jingle of metal came from within . Like a ... like a pocket full of change . <newline> <newline> I had been finding change in my couch cushions for a few weeks now . I did n't really think anything of it . I do n't carry a lot of change , but I figured some of my friends did , and that was the source . But someone had taken out all the stuffing from this cushion and replaced it with change . I undid the zipper , and sure enough , hundreds of coins were inside . A few spilled out , and I let them . I did n't know what to do . Only myself and the landlord had a key . I sure did n't ruin my cushion , and my landlord sure did n't just give away money . <newline> <newline> `` I hope that 's enough , '' a high-pitched voice broke the silence . <newline> <newline> I looked around . No one was in the apartment but me . <newline> <newline> `` Over here . On the top of the back of the couch . '' <newline> <newline> I looked at the top of the couch . There was a small spider there , but nothing else . I got up to see if the window was open . <newline> <newline> `` Where are you going ? I 'm right here ! I 'm the spider ! '' <newline> <newline> I turned around and looked closer at the spider . It moved closer to me , legs moving too fast to see . I took a step back . <newline> <newline> `` Hi ! I moved in a little while ago , but I did n't want to make myself known until I was able to pay my way . This is my part of the rent . '' The spider waved one tiny leg at the sack of change . <newline> <newline> `` Okay , '' I replied slowly , `` You 're a talking spider . A spider who talks . A spider with vocal chords or something . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , and I want to live here . This apartment building if full of delicious insects . It really is prime real estate . '' Two spider legs waved , indicating the building . <newline> <newline> I stared at the small arachnid for a few moments . `` And you 're paying rent to me ? '' <newline> <newline> The spider shook it 's body up and down-oh hell , it was nodding-and indicated the coins again . `` I can only really pay with what I find , so bills are usually out of the question . But I promise I 'll have a good amount every month . I 'll earn my keep . '' <newline> <newline> I stood there , looking at the tiny talking creature , not saying anything . <newline> <newline> `` So ... do we have an agreement ? '' The spider asked . <newline> <newline> I blinked , keeping my eyes closed for a bit longer than normal , then answered it . `` Sure . Why not ? You can have the run of the place while I 'm at work or asleep . Just steer clear when I 'm home , and definitely do n't be seen if I have anyone over . '' <newline> <newline> The spider jumped into the air , disturbingly high , then landed easily . `` Great . That works for me , you sleep a lot . I 'll get you some more money for next month . '' It began crawling towards the crack between the couch and the wall . <newline> <newline> `` But how can you speak ? '' I asked it . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , '' the spider responded , stopping for just a moment at the edge of the gap , `` It has to do with science . ''\n","16":"... Amused , I turned back to the woman ( who had a delightfully round and symmetrical posterior , I must note ) and called out to her the words `` Salve , Domina ! '' -- just to see her reaction . I was not disappointed . She froze and looked at me , puzzled and silent . <newline> <newline> `` Que ? Cat got your tongue ? It 's been a while since I 've met another Roman . '' <newline> I last met a vampire close to my seniority during the Hundred Years War , as I spat in the face of my Maker , squealing in pain beneath my boot as the sunlight burned her slender face . As one could imagine , my desire to get to know this exquisite avatar of womanhood better was tremendous ; I 've had more than my fill banging away the vampiric equivalent of jailbait for years now , and I 'd love to get together and talk to someone on my level . <newline> <newline> `` Wh-what ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's alright , dearie . We are equals ! It 's been centuries ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Excuse me ? '' She is puzzled . <newline> <newline> `` I 've been craving for some company , and you , my dear , appear to be of the resplendent , sanguine sort . Care to join me for dinner ? '' The woman smiled softly , longing in her eyes . Interesting , looking good . <newline> <newline> `` Who 's your favourite ? I tend to go wild for Vegan with a side of Welshman . Zesty , and a pleasant aftertaste . '' The woman frowned . <newline> <newline> `` No ? Please , by all means , make a sugge- '' <newline> <newline> `` Fuckin ' hell , '' she spat , `` I 'm not a fucking vampire . '' <newline> <newline> How *rude . * Quite the mouth on this one , then ... I supposed I could grow to enjoy it , if you catch my drift . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , '' I said , rolling my eyes , `` and I used to be the Queen of Lombardy . '' <newline> <newline> `` Dammit , '' she exclaimed , `` this happens every *damned* decade . Look , I 'm not a vampire . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but you should really keep your mind-probes to your self . In my day we would make you eat your own pseudopods for something like that . '' <newline> <newline> `` 'In your day ? ' 'Pseudopods ? ' '' This is quite an elaborate form of play . Curioser and curioser , indeed . <newline> <newline> `` Nevermind . Look here , I 'm not a vampire . You can see my reflection . '' She pointed to the store 's window behind her . Her reflection stood with her voluptuous backside to me there , bathed in the sickly glow of the streetlamps . <newline> <newline> Wait , what ? <newline> <newline> `` But ... Caesar ... '' <newline> <newline> `` There are other beings at work on this world that you have yet to understand , primate . '' What in the hell was this woman blabbering about ? Primate ? ! <newline> <newline> `` What *are* you , then , my most *curious* temptress ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Accusare nemo se debet nisi coram Deo ... stulte , '' she said , smirking . I think I quite like this magnificent mischievous morsel . But , with that old proverb and a sly wink , she left . I could have sworn I saw a strange black tendrils sprout from her shadow as she faded away into a bar , and my eyes are n't the type to be deceitful . All good , but what 's a bloodsucker got to do for some companionship ? ! <newline> <newline> As I walked away in fury , I stuffed my hands in my pockets -- where I discovered a crumpled piece of paper that was not there before . It was a napkin , of the sort one would find at the many dive bars here in Chicago . <newline> In a beautiful , curly script , the napkin displayed the words `` I 'm free on Tuesday , and `` baby-back ribs '' are my favorite . '' Following this were strange runes that I struggled to recognize , but written in the same dainty handwriting . They looked similar to Sumerian , close to Babylonian , yet alien in a way I had difficulty placing . I could just make out a few words ... I tried to read them . <newline> <newline> `` F ... 'Ftaghn ? ' '' <newline> <newline>\n","17":"Her human was gone . <newline> <newline> She sniffed again . <newline> <newline> Taken . <newline> <newline> A deep growl rose in her throat , threatening to come out . That was her human . Hers and hers alone . Taking a long breath in , the scent filled her . Her humans sweet perfume twisted with a smell of something new , something\u2026.different . Human but a different type of human . <newline> <newline> A twinge of fear rested on the perfume , exciting her . She will find her human and return her to their bedroom . The monster slipped out from under the closet door , flatten to a cat-like liquid form . She slithered across the floor , making imprints of the other humans left over footprints . She will find the other human and her human . <newline> <newline> Her human was taken . Rage rolled through her scaly body , through each horn , each claw . Her eyes narrowed as she slipped through the darkness in ways only monsters knew how to move . Monsters with a purpose . <newline> <newline> Her human was growing up , she knew that , but that didn \u2019 t mean that someone could TAKE her without permission . Where was the monster code of honor ? Did humans know what would happen to them when they took a monster \u2019 s human ? So few humans anymore had the capability to keep a monster at their side . So few . <newline> <newline> Monsters weren \u2019 t dwindling , that was for sure , but their bonds to the human world were weakening . Hers was one of the strongest of this last generation , but how could she be so careless as to let her human be taken ? <newline> <newline> She caught the other human and her human \u2019 s scent on the wind , changing direction swiftly , an extra burst of speed . Turning sharply into a shadow , she appeared on scene . <newline> <newline> It was a party , out in a clearing . A large fire burned brightly in the center , teenaged humans all around it . The monster took a second to pick out her human . Younger than most of them , only in her 13 or 14th year . Pretending to not be afraid . She could smell the betrayal on the other human , as she was coaxing her human to drink to drugged drink . <newline> <newline> Knowing her human had little time , the monster shot out of the darkness . Human screams filled her ears , giving her a power that sat long dormant in the monster . <newline> <newline> Wrapping up her tiny , weak human , the monster was content for a moment before the other human started screaming at her . Called her monster , devil spawn . <newline> <newline> The monster lowered her head to the other humans eye level . The other human , female , older , was a predator who lost her kill .

He had seen the ascension of those saved . He had watched as the Damned crawled up through the ground and dragged the rest to hell . Now the whole planet was devoid of humanity . <newline> <newline> The door to his office slid open . Hal 's secretary , Patti walked in . Her expression made him feel assured she shared a similar ambivalence about the situation . They watched shots of empty cities , streets , inter spliced with horrific showing yesterdays battle with the Damned . After several minutes Hal spoke <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't believe it . We are not affected . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know , sir . I think we escaped it . I do n't know which way I would go , but somehow it is an enormous relief to know I will forever be safe from that judgement . '' <newline> <newline> The pair sat in silent for several more minutes .

'' <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck does this mean ! Religion has been dead to me for so long . It just seemed silly in light of everything humanity has accomplished in the past few decades . Patti , I watched the Four Horseman descend from the fucking sky and decimate humanity . What does this mean for us ? Are we out of the fucking dogma ? Do we just go to sleep when we die ? What ? '' <newline> <newline> Patti had been contemplating that same thing . <newline> <newline> `` The way I see it there are two possibilities . '' <newline> <newline> Hal stared at her intently . She continued . <newline> <newline> `` The first would be what you just said . We are exempt here on Mars . We go to sleep that 's it . '' <newline> <newline> Hal nodded anxiously . She continued . <newline> <newline> `` The second would be that we are now in the domain of another deity . '' <newline> <newline> Patti walked by behind Hal and began massaging his shoulders . He relaxed in her grip . <newline> <newline> `` We may now be under the thumb of an incredibly benevolent and merciful God . One who loves our troubled race without reservation , and delivers us all to paradise when our time comes . '' <newline> <newline> Hal hummed a peaceful affirmation . Patti drew a twisted and evil looking dagger from within her jacket . She continued . <newline> <newline> `` But that is not Mars , Hal . You were not so fortunate . '' <newline> <newline> Something in her voice had changed . Something that made Hal stiffen , but paralyzed him . He could not move although mortal panic now gripped him . <newline> <newline> `` Our new God is old , Hal . Old and angry . We disgust him . And there is no hope of redemption . No martyr for our sins . Hell is paradise compared to his home . Our home . It 's time for you to see . '' <newline> <newline> Hal tried to speak but all he could manage was a soft whimper . Patti jammed the blade into the side of Hal 's neck . Then quickly began sawing through his throat . <newline> <newline> `` Bless me lord of the Red planet !

'' the young Sheriff asked . <newline> <newline> `` No . Nothing this , '' Emerson paused , `` savage . '' <newline> <newline> The face of the corpse had been smashed open like a rotten watermelon . They had found the gore covered claw hammer a few feet away from the corpse in the brush . <newline> <newline> `` This was personal . Help me cut the rest of his shirt away . '' <newline> <newline> They cut the blood stained shirt that used to be white , off of the body , then placed it into a large plastic evidence bag and sealed it . <newline> <newline> The Sheriff gasped when he saw the man 's bare chest . <newline> <newline> Faces of women were tattooed across the man 's torso . Each portrait perfectly capturing their likeness . Beneath each tattoo was a name . Beth , Amber , Tiffany , Candy , Emily , Karla , Jeanne , Jess . <newline> <newline> Emerson took photos of the tattoos as he worked his way around the corpse . As he got to the shoulder he realized the arms told a story of their own . <newline> <newline> A length of chain was tattooed around the bicep , a cheap one use camera , a stained mattress , a ball gag , knives of various sizes , a meat hook . <newline> <newline> With each photo Emerson took , the pieces began to fall into place . <newline> <newline> `` How many women are there Sheriff ?

Broken twigs and branches led him deeper into the woods . He would have walked past the small brown log cabin tucked into a thick growth of trees if he had n't heard a low buzzing sound . <newline> <newline> The old wooden door was slightly ajar , Emerson drew his pistol and pushed inside . The cabin smelled like wet rot and butchered meat . Bile rose in his throat , not because of the smell , but because he knew what it belonged to . Floor boards creaked underneath his feet as he walked toward a closed door on the back wall . With each step the buzzing grew louder . He pressed his shoulder against the door and took a deep breath . Gently he pushed the door open holding his pistol at the ready . <newline> <newline> A young woman sat in a folding metal chair , tattoo gun held in her hand . <newline> <newline> `` Miss , I 'm Special Agent Emerson .

Be it a baby being stolen from its parents and eating a coyote , or rather taking a military grade AR-15 assault rifle to the dog 's head . People die every day , and accordingly in a matter of throat choking , flesh splitting , brain busting , and mutilating moments a murderer is made . Anything is possible . <newline> <newline> *Tuesday , March 10 , 1969* <newline> <newline> Across the country multiple acidhead hippies decided that were many other better things to do rather than protests the government and appear on magazine covers . They decided that the simple alternative to all of this neo liberal bullshit was to get up , find a dealer , and start consuming buckets of psychedelic LSD . From Jimi Hendrix to Bill Clinton , everyone was hooked on this shit0 . <newline> Noted in multiple entries in many different scientific journals , the effect of narcotics can have a variety of effects on different animals aside from humans . For example , Catnip can be used as an air freshener for your grandmother 's house , yet also stoning the living daylights out of her tabbie . To a more extreme degree , it was also observed that the effect of LSD on many rodents serve as a methamphetamine type of hook . Subject to such substance abuse , it is a common hippie practice to \u201c Fuck with the tree rats \u201d by serving them teaspoon servings of acid ( LSD ) . <newline> As for Billy Joe , and Bobby Sue , the outcome of this inhumane experiment would turn unexpectedly deadly . <newline> <newline> *Wednesday the following week , March 18 , 1969* <newline> <newline> Few things have surprised my eyes more than the following .

Aside from all the heinous acts of hazing and illegal substance abuse , I have never found myself come so close to a case as gory and bloodcurdling as what I am about to tell you . My report follows . <newline> <newline> *Thursday , March 12 , 1969* <newline> <newline> After sitting around their trailer park living room in oakland california , Billy Joe and Bobby Sue decided that during an acid induced trip , that the greatest way to become one with nature , was to intoxify various rodents with narcotics such as Cocaine , Marijuana , and most abusively LSD . Staggering out of their screened door , Billy took two paces for each stair , only moving down when his sandal laced feet were on the same step as each other . Bobby Sue on the other hand had a much more difficult time . Holding a spoon filled with the \u201c Magic Purple Shit \u201d as they referred to it , at an arm \u2019 s length . She danced uncontrollably down the three steps courageously humming Hindu prayers , slurred into conjunction with Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds by the Beatles ( a.k.a L.S.D ) . <newline> <newline> After crouching beside their trailer , Billy Joe and Bobby Sue waited patiently for their woodland victim . Unfortunately , there would be no victim in this incident besides them . <newline> <newline> *Thursday the following week , March 19 , 1969* <newline> <newline> My compiled details follow <newline> <newline> Billy Joe was found in a fetal position , with his dreadlocks torn out of his skull with ruthless malevolence <newline> <newline> Bobby Sue was found on top of her husband , covered blood , and on top of her left eye , a small sample of squirrel feces . <newline> <newline> After sampling the feces we found that the high concentration of serotonin proteins in the feces , that it was a product of human flesh combined with an unusual amount of LSD . <newline> <newline> This leads us to believe that Billy Joe and Bobby Sue believed they were on with nature during an acid trip and accordingly committed an act of self proclaimed self cannibalism by encouraging the intoxified squirrel to gruesomely murder them and hopefully become one with their spirits . <newline> <newline> At this time , l came to the conclusion that Billy Joe and Bobby Sue had committed suicide as of Friday the 13th , 1969 , and has only left me with the impression that had Billy Joe and Bobby Sue been a present day representation of Adam and Eve , the human race would have certainly been doomed .\n","22":"> Marker <newline> <newline> > Deliberation <newline> <newline> > Decision <newline> <newline> > Information <newline> <newline> > Command <newline> <newline> A blue green spot appeared on my forehead one day , and I , like many others , *knew* . <newline> <newline> It turned out that our biosphere was in fact a fledgling hivemind .

I should 've known something was up when he applied with the name 'Siddaman Yor , ' a name I could n't even find with the most exotic Google searches . I should 've known something was up when he tried using the mop like a magic wand to clean up spilled coffee . I should 've known something was up when he called our brand old 3D printer 'the most charming non-magic form of sorcery he 'd ever seen . ' <newline> <newline> But I did n't , because Syd commanded an air of ineducable mysticism so unnervingly charming that I could n't help but notice how blue the sky was , or how simply pleasant it was to hear the robins sing . Even when I had to show the guy how to use a phone , I did n't pay him any attention . It was like my mind became all cloudy whenever I was around him . <newline> <newline> What tipped me off that he was different was when he kept *apologizing* for mystifying me . Said something like , `` It 's difficult for me to control it '' and `` My power is just too big these days . '' <newline> <newline> At the time , I thought he was bragging about his penis , and I pat his shoulder and told him he 's an impressive little man who did n't need to worry about it . <newline> <newline> `` We 're all special in our own way , '' I said . `` My magic wand is semi-autonomous , like Elon Musk 's cars . '' <newline> <newline> His eyes flared and he said , `` What make is your wand ? Was it crafted by Sarlon of Vayeci ? '' <newline> <newline> And I walked briskly back to my desk , the conversation having spiraled out of control into areas that reminded me of my childhood at summer camp . <newline> <newline> Not much happened for the rest of the day , until I heard his familiar Ozzy Osborne-esque timbre wailing at his overturned bucket . He was speaking some freakish language that sounded like a mix between Latin and Chinese . The water floated and condensed into an orb , and with a thrust of his hand , he pushed it into the bucket as if it were some magic spell . <newline> <newline> I made the sign of the cross and ran . Did n't have anymore problems from Syd after that\u2014 I think he finally got this whole 'normality ' thing down\u2014 but I still kept my distance . <newline> <newline> The day did n't end so splendidly when a goblin busted into my office and held me at ax-point , demanding the location of 'the one known as Siddaman Yor .

It was the second the signature on the piece of paper , the first had nervously been planted by the gentle , wet hand of the older gentleman sitting uncomfortably in front of him . <newline> <newline> `` And you said it will only take a few days ?

'' <newline> <newline> The second man , suited , lounging behind the large mahogany desk covered in models and concepts and fat folders filled with sums and figures , paused for a moment and looked over the top of his glasses . `` Oh yes , indeed they will '' , another nonchalant signature went down forming a big sprawling signature , `` you 'll have nothing to worry about in the end , we 'll be taking care of everything . '' <newline> <newline> The hat rotated several more times while the final , awaited signature was signed off with a loud forceful fullstop . Silence now hung in the air like the pen which lingered over the contract . Both seemed to be considering the full repercussions of the action before the pen was carefully returned to the gilded holder which sat to one side . <newline> <newline> `` Done '' the suited man announced cheerfully , a smile constructed on his face `` Now if you go and see Katherine sort out the last remaining bits and bobs , not least the account you 'll want the money transferred to . One needs to know these details when trying to provide for ones family after all . '' <newline> <newline> The balding grey head nodded in agreement , eyes now downcast onto the floor . `` I must , must n't I. I thought I had saved enough you know . For my wife and I , my retirement , my children and my grandchildren . '' One hand detached itself from the hat and he wiped the forming tears away , `` But at you least you 've been good . Offering me all those loans , even when interest rates and it became harder to afford the repayments . I needed those to feed my family , to house them , to keep them warm . '' <newline> <newline> The smile seemed to expand even more as the suited man replied `` And that 's why we 're letting you live in the house . We 're not heartless you know . You get all the money and get to keep living in the house until the term of the contract expires . '' <newline> <newline> The hand slowly reattached itself to the battered hat , then hat was slowly lifted up and planted gingerly on top his head , `` I 'm sure we can find another smaller place , I 've heard of worse than 6 people in a two bedroom house . '' Slowly , fighting and using his hands as the roots to raise him up he stood and shuffled his way to the door . <newline> <newline> `` But I might need some help then . And I think once I 'm gone my children might definitely need help . It 's hard to get a hand up in life without some help .

The contract clad in a thick rubber band was deposited with the rest in a filer draw . `` Oh we can help . We 're always quite ready to help . You , your children , grandchilden , we hope we can help them all . I hope to say we can help them forever . As long as they can agree to our terms that is .

The pen was from its resting position and put it use again , scoring through the final name on a list of other struck through names . It would take few years longer than he had hoped , as it had taken to get to this point . The pen moved on the golf course plan as it fabricated his dream design . He would get what he wanted , and there might be some waiting involved , but his desires would not be kept from him . <newline> <newline> `` Just remember '' he said to nobody in particular as he renovated and removed `` you can always trust your bank .

She touched the boy on the shoulder , and he knelt . `` You are no one , '' she intoned ritually , her voice stretching out to reach every ear in the village . `` You have no name and no place in the world . '' <newline> <newline> The boy saw a girl standing outside her family 's hut . She waved at him with a surreptitious motion of her fingers , and he hid a smile . Over the years , he had often hoped that his name would be a good one that was strong enough to bring her to his side . In his most secret thoughts , he sometimes thought of her as Beautiful . He was ashamed of it . It was not his place to name her . But sometimes , he thought it anyway . <newline> <newline> Voice of Spirits continued , `` It has been fifteen summers and one day since you entered this world , nameless one , and today is the day you will walk the Road . '' Her long arm swept out and a knotty finger pointed . The ceremonial gate interrupted no wall . It stood alone on the northern edge of the village . White spirit-marks slanted this way and that atop its red timbers . As she pointed , her apprentices pulled the gate open . Beyond it was a stone path leading straight as an arrow into the virgin forest . The other three directions were for people to use , but the North was the spirits ' way . The people did not touch the northern forest and did not travel into it , except on one occasion . <newline> <newline> `` The Road belongs to the spirits , '' Voice of Spirits said gravely . `` Nameless , you do not belong in this world . Nameless , you are like a spirit that walks . You and you alone may go among the spirits . If you live , if you return , you will return with a name , and we will know you at last . '' <newline> <newline> Voice of Spirits put a hand under the boy 's elbow , and he rose smoothly to his feet . She dipped her fingers into the bowl of whitewash that belonged to the spirits , and she painted marks on his face with sure , swift strokes . `` The spirits will recognize you , and in time they will tell you your name . '' An apprentice came up the boulder , holding the boy 's iron-headed hatchet . Voice of Spirits took it from his hands and turned to place it in the boy 's . She raised her arms to the sky . The villagers mimicked her and joined their voices to hers for the last words of the ritual . `` No one leaves , but no one does not return . ''\n","29":"My hands are trembling under the look of the creature before me . His massive wings are decorated with gold and his human body is fierce , but scarred . <newline> <newline> 'Who are you ? ' My stem feels weak and my throat is dry . Then there is silence . After a while of torture under the gaze of the creature , he finally answers . <newline> <newline> 'I am a man of many names , but you may call me Michael . You 've been chosen . ' The voice of the divine being is coming from everywhere around me . Dazzled , I look upon him and then I realize it ... <newline> <newline> 'You 're an angel ? But ... I do n't want to die . I 'm not even 80 . I ca n't leave my company and my family alone . ' <newline> <newline> 'I am not here to kill you , although your reputation is questionable . You 've been granted one wish . You can wish , whatever you want , but you must face the consequenses . The angel looks at me . 'Say your wish human . ' <newline> <newline> 'But why me ? What 's the catch ? ' <newline> <newline> 'God 's ways are incomprehensible . ' He says with a sly grim . 'And you are one of the few , who knows for real what he wants . So what will it be ? ' <newline> <newline> Finally , after all these years , my wish has come true . <newline> <newline> 'I just want to grab them ALL by the pussy . ' <newline> <newline> And so it was . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","30":"It was a nice Holiday for William , relaxing next to a pool at a luxury resort on some foreign island . It was well deserved , he thought , because screwing people over and ruining people 's days really brought you down after a couple months . <newline> <newline> William decided he wanted to go freshen up before he returned to the surrounding town that inhabited the island he was staying on . Once he swiped the card through the door , he entered the room and took his swimming shorts off in a swift movement ; now butt naked . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's turn on some tunes , shall we ? '' He asked out to no one in particular . He grabbed something from the mini bar and downed it in one motion , letting out a refreshed sigh as he walked around the hotel room , gathering his outfit for tonight . Just as he was about to change the channel , the news anchor caught his attention . <newline> <newline> `` We are getting news from the city of Metroland that a notorious villain known as Barbarian has caused quite a stir . Reports are flooding in that his henchmen are taking various buildings hostage and , what I 'm understanding , requesting insane amounts of money . To Robert Lullman , anchor of our sister news station in Metroland . '' The red headed woman spoke . William felt a surge of anger roll through him as he grabbed his pants and pulled them on . <newline> <newline> `` Thanks Tiffany . We are being advised that they are trying to break into our building- '' the bulbous anchorman was cut off by a giant man with prehistoric garb on . <newline> <newline> `` Me Barbarian . Me want one billion dollar from land of Metro . Me take hostage now . Give me dollar or you get death , '' and the man signed the cutting of the throat crudely before the news station went blank . William was now furious . How could this buffoon take over *his* city ? ? The universal news came on and cut to live feed of the henchmen cutting down anyone who tried to run . It made for brutal television . William could n't just sit idly by as Metroland became enslaved by a giant man child and more-compotent-than-him henchmen . <newline> <newline> He had enough . <newline> <newline> William finished getting dressed and then opened up the doors to the balcony of his hotel room . In fast fashion , the mildly-overweight took off in a sonic boom to the sky , trajectory toward Metroland , USA . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> Once he entered the city , he could smell the sweet smell of burning buildings and crisp blood . It made him aroused , but he could n't think about that now . William had his mask on , making him anonymous and also making it so his face does n't freeze up in the air . His alias was known as The Jerk . He never had to crack down and actually hurt people , he just liked being a dick . <newline> <newline> Once on the ground , he angrily sulked over to a trembling young police officer , scraped up and bleeding from an obvious fight . <newline> <newline> `` Where is he ? ! '' Shouted William , grabbing him by the uniform . <newline> <newline> `` W-who ? ! '' Retorted the rookie , shaking more . <newline> <newline> `` The Barbarian fuck ! '' There was no time for a silly back and forth . <newline> <newline> `` I-in the Mayor 's off-office ! '' <newline> <newline> William did n't need anything more . He stormed off and took off , in flight once again toward the center of the city . Once there , he took out a few of the henchmen that were in his way and blasted open locked doors . He felt like an angry wife , rushing home after she heard word from her snooping neighbor named Karen that her husband was cheating on her with his yoga instructor . Flexible , but useless . <newline> No wait . <newline> <newline> Angry and bitter . <newline> <newline> He made it to the office and sure as shit , there the giant man was , sitting in the chair of Mayor Hutch , watching the cameras that viewed the entire city . William punched out a few of the sidekicks and watched as the hostages scampered off , the mayor going along with them . <newline> <newline> `` You big , dense , mother fucking potato . '' William said as the Barbarian stood up ; he towered over him by a good foot or so . And William was n't that short , either . <newline> <newline> `` Not good way to talk to me , '' boomed the manbeast . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't give a rats ass what a good way to talk to you is . This is *my* city and you do n't fuck it up . Only I fuck it up , '' William said . <newline> <newline> `` You ? Superhero ? I shit bigger than tiny puny man , '' Barbarian said as he approached William . <newline> <newline> `` No . Not a superhero . I 'm a supervillain , bitch . '' Retorted William , winding up his fist and punching the giant square in the chest . The huge man flew back , hitting against the double pained window with a loud thud . He cracked the bullet proof glass . `` And per Law 17 in section 2 of the first book of Supervillain Conduct , it is against the rules to take hostage or terrorize another supervillain 's city unless strictly with permission of said supervillain or with help by said supervillain . '' Read out William , a small compressed book in his gloved hand . `` Looks like you 're breaking the rules , thick headed man child . '' He added , cracking his neck as he shoved the book back into his back pocket . <newline> <newline> `` There book ? Barbarian no can read , '' murmured the man under his breath . <newline> <newline> `` Well , can you read this ? '' Asked William as he landed hard punch after punch , adding in so eloquently : `` Get . Out . Of . My . City . You . Buffoon . '' <newline> <newline> Barbarian held up his hands in surrender , wincing at the raised fist of William . <newline> <newline> `` Barbarian sorry . Please no report to council , Barbarian go home now . Just wanted bigger territory , '' he said , defeated . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry about it , big guy . Just learn how to read or you 're gon na get fucked over , '' William said as he pulled him up . The Barbarian let out a loud growl-like holler and the henchmen surrounding the area left . <newline> <newline> Just like that , the city of Metroland was under the terror of The Jerk again . <newline> <newline> Except The Jerk had a vacation to finish . <newline> <newline> And off he went , flying back to the undisclosed island where he had a week long stay he planned to finish .\n","31":"The child sat on the swing , gently rocking back and forth . She was n't sure of what else to do . She did n't have the dog to play with anymore , not since it ran off after she no longer had food to give it . So she swung back and forth , back and forth . <newline> <newline> A breeze rose , bringing her the smell of dung from the outhouse . She wrinkled her nose in disgust and tried to think of something exciting to do . But nothing came to mind . She had done everything she considered exciting weeks ago . She had thought of leaving , of exploring , but this was home , where her mother and father were . She could n't leave them behind . <newline> <newline> A shadow flickered in the corner of her eye . <newline> <newline> She turned to look directly at the movement . Maybe an animal was walking through . She had seen a bear once , with her father , but only from a distance . He had told her to not be scared , because animals can smell fear . She wished she could smell fear . It would be better than just smelling poop for most of the day . But there was nothing there . Not a bird , or a squirrel , or anything . <newline> <newline> Another shadow flickered to her right . <newline> <newline> She whipped her head around to stare at it . She *knew* it had moved . Her father had told her to trust her instincts too . She stopped swinging to concentrate on her surroundings . As soon as she did a shadow flickered again , flickered and became *someone* . There was no transition , there was no one , and then someone . <newline> <newline> The person stood watching her . She could n't really tell what they looked like . Her father has told her to pay attention to details , because details can tell you things . But there *were* no details . Only that the person cast no shadow . <newline> <newline> She blinked and asked , `` Why do n't you have a shadow ? '' <newline> <newline> The person chuckled , `` Did n't your parents ever tell you not to talk to strangers , child ? '' <newline> <newline> She frowned , `` Papa taught me lots of things , but there never were any strangers around for Papa to teach me about . '' <newline> <newline> `` And where is Papa ? '' <newline> <newline> Sorrow and loneliness flashed across her face , but instead of responding she asked , `` Where did you come from ? You were n't there , and then you were . '' <newline> <newline> The being shook its head , `` Unimportant , '' it paused and said , `` what is important is why I am here . '' She looked at the figure questioningly and it continued , `` I am here for you . '' <newline> <newline> The girl started swinging again . `` What do you want with me ? Do you have any food ? I 'm really hungry , '' she added . <newline> <newline> `` No , '' it said quietly , almost menacingly , `` I do not have sustenance for you . '' <newline> <newline> `` Crap , '' she sighed . Her father had told her not to swear , to use her mind instead of using whatever words other people thought were right for a situation . But she had heard him swear a couple of times , and he was n't here to catch her . `` Who are you anyway ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I am Death . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh . '' She thought for a moment , `` Is that why you can just appear places ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' It stared at her , with that face that she could n't remember even while she was looking at it , and cocked its head . `` It 's time for you to come with me . `` She pouted and began to retort , but it forestalled her by saying , `` You are the last . '' <newline> <newline> She did n't know what to say . The way it had said that made her scared . She was the last of what ? But her father had taught her to not ask the obvious questions . Instead she said , `` Will there be food where we are going ? '' <newline> <newline> It stood silent for a minute , just gazing at her . When it spoke , its voice was confident and calming . `` I do not know . I am only the Guide . I have journeyed with all of your kind , from the very beginning thousands of years ago , to the end , '' it glanced away , `` which is today . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh . '' The little girl was silent on her swing for some time . She slowly came to a stop and got off the seat her father had made for her . It had carvings of leaves on the sides and bottom , to 'blend into the trees ' as her father had told her . `` Will you hold my hand ? '' She knew she smelled of fear . Maybe Death could smell it . She added in a small voice , `` I 'm scared . '' <newline> <newline> Death only smiled and reached out a hand for her to grab . She closed her eyes and grabbed on tight . The blackness seemed permanent . <newline> <newline> Another breeze rose up , carrying with it the smells of nature , and the sound of birds . The swing hanging from the tree slowly drifted back and forth .\n","32":"Mines technically an EU , but it came to mind first . <newline> <newline> He was a normal looking kid . Scrawny even . Spiky white hair , cargo shorts every day , and a tank top that showed some thin arms . Defined , sure , but in the same way our star cross country runner was . No meat on his bones . <newline> <newline> I looked away again . No telling what this kid could do . I 'd never seen a ten in my life . That was saying something . My dad ran a private security company for the rich and powerful . Not the famous type . The really big guys in the world . <newline> <newline> I took another look , activating my nen , only for the third time . You never know when someone will notice nen activating . Especially not a ten . <newline> <newline> His name was Killua . I knew that from talking to him . I knew the tricks of the trade , interrogation without people noticing , surveillance , the whole deal . You do n't grow up in my family business without it . God , this kid though . I could n't get him out of my mind . The best my dad employed was an eight . A freakin ' eight was one of the most sought after body-guards in the world . <newline> <newline> A fuckin ' ten . I knew my power . It sorted based on your relative strength compared to the rest of the world . Killua was in the top 1 % . Slouching , hands in his pockets , quiet Killua was one of the most deadly nen users in the world . <newline> I activated Gyo . The principle walked in . Killua was gone , the principle and the two men next to him , my father and his body guard , were both dead . He turned and looked at me . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry . The Zoldyck 's send their regards . '' <newline> <newline> He left . I took the comm device from my dad , and told the rest of the guards not to try to stop him , but they did anyways . Six of our company 's best , downed . At least it was a Zoldyck . I owe them for saying it in front of witnesses so that my dad 's company , MY company , wo n't be ruined for this that way .\n","33":"<newline> Today is the anniversary of the last time a child was born on Earth . <newline> <newline> Today is my birthday . <newline> <newline> The numbers began to appear the same day the stars began to fade . A cluster of stars disappeared from the sky and all of the children that entered the world that day were emblazoned with a mark on their upper right arm : X <newline> <newline> Astronomers were dumbfounded , as were the doctors . They called these children the Fallen Lights . They underwent experiments and were mocked and cast out in some cultures and religions . <newline> <newline> But every day more children were born with the mark and more stars blinked out of existence . Soon , everyone bore the mark . <newline> <newline> Hundreds of years passed , billions of stars disappeared , and the marks began to change . Children began to be born with 10M emblazoned on their arms . One million children were born and then 9M appeared , then 8M , 7M , and so on . The numbers dwindled quickly and answers were once again sought after . <newline> <newline> My sister 's mark is 2M . My best friend wears 8K . I met someone who wore 32 , another who had 7 . <newline> <newline> I am number one . <newline> <newline> The same day I was conceived was the same day women everywhere were incapable of becoming pregnant . When I was born , the sky went dark forever . <newline> <newline> The truth was exactly what we all feared it to be : humanity was coming to an end -- slowly and quietly . Just as the stars flickered out in the night , we would watch our numbers dwindle into extinction . <newline> <newline> They had to hide me . Many thought they could sacrifice me and restore the light . Some thought that I was the next Adam . They were all wrong . I was simply the last , and they were afraid that we would all die in the dark . <newline> <newline> They called me the one who stole the sun . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","34":"I do n't know how anyone else sees it but to me 20 years is an awfully long time . <newline> <newline> When we 're born , we have no idea what our ultimates are . Most researchers seem to think they arise out of `` hidden potential '' . After that , they remain in a state of permanency : when you call them again they 'll have the same effect as the first time . <newline> <newline> Some people never use their ultimates . They wait and wait for the opportune moment and it never comes ; fact is , most people do n't have crisis `` make or break '' moments in their lives . It got to the point where the terminally ill would always be sent home when they reached critical condition ; whilst most ultimates are harmless in the damage sense , some have explosive or violent potential . <newline> <newline> I used my ultimate for the first time when I was 24 . I 'd just qualified as a nurse and was working diligently on some paperwork when the first victims came in . Some kind of experimental bomb had gone off in the upper atmosphere . Thousands with toxins in the bloodstream , unable to breathe . Those inside had n't been hit too hard at first but as the minutes ticked by and the vapours circulated around even the largest buildings , we started to feel the effects , myself included . <newline> <newline> I did n't know what to do . We needed a solution but our chemists were stumped , and surgery was n't helping . People were dying . <newline> <newline> I remember thinking that we needed a solution to this problem , right now . <newline> <newline> I checked my wristwatch , noted the time , and dropped my ultimate . And suddenly , everything became clear . I knew exactly what I had to do . I walked to the lab , batted the confused technicians aside and worked harder than I 'd ever worked in my life . <newline> <newline> They called my ultimate a `` hyper-processing '' ultimate . They said it gathered things I 'd already heard or seen or done and put them to use ; even if I 'd long since forgotten . A niche power that came through in the moment but did n't have any world-breaking applications . <newline> <newline> They never caught the person who made that bomb . I wish they had . When the T Plague happened 10 years later , we could have really used my ultimate . Over 20,000 people died in six days . <newline> <newline> The next time I used my ultimate was at the age of 46 . I 'd been in the bank when an armed robbery had started . They 'd tied our arms and put bags over our heads to keep us quiet . The situation had built to a standoff between the Police and the thieves which kept getting worse . One of the hostages had dropped his super strength ultimate and been immediately shot by one of the criminals . The Police would not let them get away , and as the criminals prepared to shoot another hostage ( a young cashier ) she had screamed for someone to help her . <newline> <newline> I remember thinking that I needed to save all these people from the robbers . <newline> <newline> I dropped my ultimate . What happened next is a blur to me . But when my ultimate ended I was stood in the middle of the room with seven incapacitated criminals next to me . <newline> <newline> My arms were still tied behind my back with a bag over my head . Blinded . <newline> <newline> All seven of the criminals had dropped their ultimates . <newline> <newline> I 'd stopped all of them . <newline> <newline> At the end of it all , the press had reported my success as a victory of `` brains over brawn '' , where my own experiences watching martial arts movies and so on had been reproduced by my ultimate . <newline> <newline> They 'd said that my ultimate was a hyper-processing ultimate . <newline> <newline> They were absolutely 100 % wrong . <newline> <newline> I am now 66 . Exactly 20 long years since my last ultimate . I have spent the past six years gathering supplies and restocking a lab . It 's been difficult ; the world has really gone bad in the last fifteen years . Economically , the entire country is bankrupt . The environment is worse than it 's ever been thanks to a brief nuclear skirmish between some small countries . I 'm still working at the hospital , but we ca n't help most of the people that come in . We simply do n't have the resources . Crime is high . And once again , people are dying . My own family included . <newline> <newline> We need a way out . Too many problems , not enough solutions . <newline> <newline> As I drop my long-awaited ultimate , I think that I need to be able to use my ultimate more often . <newline> <newline> An hour later there is a solution on the table .\n","35":"The subject smiled . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the surviving researcher could feel a bright , warm light spreading throughout his body . He let go of the gun in shock , bringing his hands to his chest . He could feel the indescribably powerful force cascading through his essence , wiping out all traces of the fear which only seconds ago had driven him to the point of insanity . <newline> <newline> Love . <newline> <newline> He knew the emotion when he felt it , but had never known it in a form that was this strong , this insatiably pure . His eyes flitted back towards the man , who still wore his cardboard smile . He could see through the smile like a window into the deprived mind lying just behind the clenched teeth . What he saw was not madness , but the greatest sense of peace and calm he had ever known . <newline> <newline> `` How ? Why ? '' He remembered the earlier observations , the way that the prisoners so wantonly destroyed eachother and themselves . <newline> <newline> `` It 'll all be ogre soon . '' The subject dropped his smile , yet the raw sensation of nearly orgasmic bliss remained . The researcher slumped against the cell , barely aware of the dozens of preening eyes that carefully observed his every move . `` Better check yourself before you shrek yourself '' . It was then that the researcher noticed that the prisoner was n't moving his lips as he spoke , nor was the sound originating from him . He looked over , but only caught a glimpse of the hulking figure lurking on the other side of the room before his vision went black . <newline> <newline> All the former sensations of bliss and beauty were banished into some forsaken realm from which they were not soon to return . They were destined to be replaced by the agony which was to follow the researcher 's blindness ; a sensation even stronger than the love which had enraptured his mind only seconds ago . <newline> <newline> The voice spoke again : `` Bend ovah donkeh . '' It was impossibly charismatic , as if the mere nature of its inflection was sufficient to entirely control a person . <newline> <newline> Before he could act on the voice 's prompt , the researcher felt himself falling down into a vast and mysterious unknown . Nothing but a cold and inky blackness met his sight as he struggled to discover his location . <newline> <newline> All of a sudden , he heard the unmistakable sound of knuckles cracking . `` This is my swamp . '' After that , there was only pain . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","36":"None of us knew it was coming . Which was weird , because if something happened back on Earth , Luna Control was usually the first to know since we could see it with binoculars if we looked hard enough . <newline> <newline> But this time , all there was , all communication with Earth Dispatch ceased . It was like the building lost power , which was impossible since it had five backup generators hooked to it to keep shit like this from happening , but it happened all the same . Nothing we tried worked , changing channels , boosting signal , switching receivers . No one was answering . <newline> <newline> Luna Control leaders figured whatever had made Earth Dispatch go hush-hush all of a sudden without telling us was worth checking out . A hastily set up scout crew was put on a ship made of bubblegum and prayers and sent to Earth with the simple goal of : figure out what happened and get news to the colonies . We would n't last long without support from the home planet ; it 's not like there 's a lot out here in the way of food . <newline> <newline> When the scout team arrived , they found a number of things odd . One , there was no one . There were some ashes on the ground and shoes in the middle of piles of clothes , but nothing else in the way of bodies . Two , in human 's place there were these ... things . Monsters , I suppose is the right word , but they did n't look like anything anyone in the party recognized and were definitely ready to kill . They stayed away from them as much as possible , but as they opened the door to enter the Earth Dispatch building , they came face to face with one of the Big Uglies . <newline> <newline> Instead of pouncing and devouring , as they were sure was going to happen , it took a long look at them , sniffed the air , and walked past them to roam the streets of New York . It was like he could smell that they were off-worlders . <newline> <newline> There was no one left on Earth . They were all gone . Religious people said it was the Rapture , and no one had any better theories . <newline> <newline> But since there was no one on Earth , no one could get supplies out to the colonies , since the Moon and Mars are n't very resource rich . Lunar Control knew this . They took emergency leadership and organized a mass exodus not away from our homes , but to it . <newline> <newline> The last transport from Mars just arrived yesterday . Looks like we 'll have to start from the beginning . And God , if you 're listening to me , please do n't kill me . I still have a lot to live for . We all do now , living for humanity 's memory . Though it wo n't survive for long , anyway .\n","37":"Casey had his heart first broken at the age of five , when his horseshoe-haired father came home from Friday happy hour stinking of rye whiskey and lashed a belt around his wrist . He let the buckle free , though , and cracked it over Casey 's back like a whip . That was Casey 's first memory of speaking , when he screamed `` no , no , no , '' and his father ignored that . <newline> <newline> And yet it was his father who broke his heart again , when Casey was eleven , moving out of the house finally and turning Casey 's mother into a single mother . Casey never saw his father after that , but when Casey heard his mother crying Christmas morning because she could n't afford presents for the kids , his heart broke , and he blamed his father . He hugged his mom and told her not to cry , that he did n't need any presents , but in his right hand he made a fist and thought of finding and beating his dad , of making him say `` no , no , no , '' and ignoring that . <newline> <newline> Casey 's mother was a willowy woman prone to wearing nightgowns all day and putting out cigarettes in the wetness of dirty plates in the kitchen sink . She smoked other things , too , Casey knew , but he never asked about the strange smells coming from the basement when her boyfriends would come over , sometimes all at once . One of them beat her once , or at least grabbed her , Casey never knew what the man 's intentions were , because Casey struck the man in the face so hard he shouted `` no , no , no , '' but Casey ignored that . His mother screamed at him for that , but in the morning she confessed that she was glad to be rid of another abusive male figure in his life . <newline> <newline> His heart was broken before prom thrice . Layla with her brunette-auburn hair that glistened in the sun like copper told him `` no , '' and he did n't ignore that . Brooklyn with her bright blue eyes told him `` no , '' and added in a few choice words for him , that he was the son of a deadbeat from the wrong part of town , and he could n't ignore that , but he pretended to . Then when Lisa told him `` no , '' something in Casey snapped and later when he was alone he punched a locker , and then cried because he hated making fists . Fists reminded him of his dad , and he would never be like his dad . But then he punched the locker again , and his mind said `` no , no , no , '' but he ignored that . <newline> <newline> He did n't make it into college , but that did n't break his heart . By then he was used to rejection and being told that he did n't matter . He stayed at home and went to community college instead , and his mother told him to move out , but he told her no , no , no , and she ignored that . He wanted to be a plumber . He 'd heard that plumbers make good money and he would never be a deadbeat like his dad was , even if he could n't make it in a fancy four-year school , he would be a plumber and never make a fist again . Except one night when his mother went to hit him in one of her own drunken stupors , he made a fist and thought about it , but he said no , no , no , and he woke up glad he did n't ignore that . <newline> <newline> The last time Casey had his heart broken was Sue , a girl he 'd met at a bar just outside of town . She made him feel good . She liked his callused hands , and when she held them open Casey knew he could never make a fist to this girl . They saw a movie and laughed by making fun of the overracting of the villain , with Sue doing his high-pitched voice in an uncanny whine . She cracked him up , and he thought it was going somewhere , but when he found out she had a boyfriend and that he had been paying for all their dates for nothing , he felt his heart break again , but again he told himself no , no , no , he would not be the man his father was . His life sucked , but that did n't mean *he* had to suck . *The cycle breaks with me . * <newline> <newline> Then one day he got drunk on rye whiskey at McKakesie 's downtown and he saw Sue with her boyfriend across the way , and he sat there stewing . It felt good to be drunk , because remembering his father with numbness was not so bad . Remembering his mother with numbness was not so bad either . The bartender said something about being cut off , and Casey walked outside , and kept walking under the streetlamps until he could n't count them anymore , and then he arrived at Sue 's house , he knew what he was going to do . He was going to be the opposite of his father . He was going to be nice to Sue . So nice . *Forgive her* . *In person . * He was going to be nice to her , he resolved , and he was going to treat her right and she would understand that they were meant to be together .

He was right . <newline> <newline> A few months ago my friend called me with obvious excitement , exclaiming that in exactly fifty days his life would change forever . He did n't want to spoil the surprise , but ended up spilling the beans . He had been chosen for a test that he said would be either amazing or have life threatening consequences . Becoming bored with his nine to five life , he took the risk knowing that his choice would be permanent . The problem was , it really was a choice and he needed my help in making it . <newline> <newline> We took the two pills , and tried to come up with a way to choose which one he should take . Jokingly he suggested both . We looked at each other , then shook our heads . Clearly those running the experiment would n't let both pills work together . . . right ? We eventually decided not to let our greed get the best of us . A pro\/con chart helped , we asked his family , even setup a fake survey on reddit to see what people would pick themselves . Even then we could n't decide .

'' the headmaster asked me , staring intently at the door through which they had just left . The headmaster knew - he had known for a long time - about my peculiar gift . I could see the danger in people . I could tell with a glance that manifested as a number in my head , on a simple one to ten scale . Dr. Butler , the headmaster , said the perfect wholeness and symmetry of the numbers was a sure sign that this was a gift from God , and as such I was to use it to warn all good Christians of His enemies . <newline> <newline> `` Most of the boys are a three or four , '' I told him . I glanced at the headmaster 's ledger . At the top of each page was written , *Shrewsbury School for Boys* and at the bottom *Anno Dmoini 1818 . * Each new boy 's name was written on the left , and as he read aloud each one , I gave the number . <newline> <newline> `` Davies ?

'' I stirred uncomfortably in my chair as the headmaster wrote an extended not in his ledger , shaking his head at the horribly dangerous boy Hughes . Normally a seven was reserved for a full grown man who had served at least one tour in the military , or for certain criminal types . <newline> <newline> `` Dr. Butler , '' I interrupted him . <newline> <newline> `` Yes boy , what is it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The seven ... that 's not the highest number I saw today . '' <newline> <newline> `` You saw an *eight* ? Good grief , which one was that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No sir , not an eight . A ten . '' <newline> <newline> The colour drained from the headmaster 's face as he sat suddenly frozen in his chair . `` You 're sure ? '' he asked , `` Absolutely sure ? '' <newline> <newline> I nodded , the fear showing in my face as well . <newline> <newline> `` Well out with it then , which one was it ? ! '' The headmaster was half standing over the ledger , reaching for more paper and his seals . Presumably all the teachers and staff would be warned about this boy . I leaned over the desk and looked down the ledger , trying to find the name . <newline> <newline> `` This one , '' I said , pointing , `` down at the bottom of the first page . '' The headmaster seemed surprised . <newline> <newline> `` Are you absolutely sure ? '' he asked , `` Why , his brother has been with us for four years already , and he is no more than a three . '' <newline> <newline> `` He is a ten , '' I said , confirming . Dr. Butler began moving about his desk again , mumbling to himself about how he must warn everybody , and that any bad behavior from this boy would be entirely unacceptable . I just sat and stared at that name , which would now haunt me as the only ten I would ever see : Darwin .\n","41":"It was a day no different from any other , rain falling as it is prone to do in a Cascadian winter .

'' <newline> <newline> Pulling one envelope out from the rest , Hikaru took a closer look at it . `` From my brother ? Have n't heard from him in forever . '' Absently , he dropped the rest of the mail onto the kitchen table and walked into the living room , where he sat down in his recliner and opened the letter . <newline> <newline> It was a short letter , with a small newspaper clipping taped to it . As he scanned over the newspaper clipping , having been unable to decipher his brother 's horrid handwriting , his eyes widened and his hands started shaking . Gingerly , he stood back up , crumpling the letter in his hands , and staggered through the house to his bedroom . <newline> <newline> Hours later , Raiko was surprised to come home to a quiet house . Hikaru 's car was in the driveway and the dog was in the kennel , so he had n't left for a walk . She let the dog out of her kennel and wandered through the house , looking for her partner . She found him curled up in bed , cocooned in blankets , not asleep but wide-eyed and staring blankly at the wall . <newline> <newline> Hikaru jerked away when Raiko touched his head , taking a shuddering breath . <newline> <newline> `` What 's wrong ?

I did n't feel anything , of course . I had my body calibrated to ignore pain signals beyond a certain threshold . I heard my headplate shatter , scattering bits of simulated skin across the ground . My visual centres simply fuzzed out before blacking out altogether . I felt someone shift my body around and then a sharp crackle as something broke through my chest- <newline> <newline> Then I woke up , unable to move . <newline> <newline> I do n't remember what happened the exact moment my body unit got destroyed . I just woke up back at headquarters- the last few seconds of data missing from the unit I 'd lost in the field . <newline> <newline> I could n't see anything . I could n't feel anything . <newline> <newline> I was just in a dark , empty place for almost too long before the recovery unit started downloading me into a temporary frame . <newline> <newline> I saw something briefly . I do n't know how it happened- maybe a stray signal or something- someone reaching down into my broken field unit and peeling off the skull plate , rooting around inside my discarded cyberbrain- <newline> <newline> *I ... am dead . I 'm also alive . Maybe . * <newline> <newline> I did n't understand . I felt my limbs twitch and flail wildly . Everything felt wrong- different . Wires detached from the base of my new body and I fell to the ground inside the recovery unit . <newline> <newline> *Am I in the recovery unit ? Are n't I also lying in an alley somewhere , having my body ransacked for parts ? Where am I ? * <newline> <newline> I did n't understand . I curled up inside the narrow space in the unit and refused to open my new eyes . It was too confusing . I did n't know what to do . <newline> <newline> The seal of the recovery unit parted and the hatch drew back . I sensed light on the skin of my new body but I did n't move . <newline> <newline> `` You 're alive . '' Someone said , `` Just dreaming . Pretend you were just sleeping in this unit the whole time . '' <newline> <newline> I crawled to my feet , leaning against the walls of the recovery unit . One of my hands clutched the frame of the unit , feeling new and soft . <newline> <newline> `` But I was n't dreaming . '' I could n't help but say , `` Someone is inside my head , taking me apart- '' <newline> <newline> I flinched as I felt someone rooting around my system , suddenly locking me out . My eyelids opened without my input and I stared at the maintenance worker in front of me . <newline> <newline> She looked at me expressionlessly , holding up a scanner which she waved in my direction . <newline> <newline> `` Pretend it was just me all along . '' she said idly , `` Can you get out ? I need to prep this unit in case someone else happens to conk out in the field . '' <newline> <newline> She released me from her control . I stumbled forward , trying to get used to the new body . It was different , a standard body of a standard height and size , nothing more than a mannequin to stand in for the real thing . <newline> <newline> *This is n't me . This is n't me . This is n't me . * <newline> <newline> My hand twitched erratically . Shivering . I could n't stop it . The maintenance worker saw I was taking too long to get out and tugged me out of the unit , stepping inside to fiddle with something in the dark . <newline> <newline> I stumbled past the coffin like recovery units and out into the corridor outside the recovery unit room , searching for the way to my bunk . I was supposed to go to the debriefing room to wait for the rest of the team to return . I kept getting automatic reminders appearing in digital windows on the walls in my vision but I ignored them . <newline> <newline> I was thinking about erasing this whole incident actually . Maybe my mind would come to terms with this better if I just did n't have to think about it . <newline> <newline> But I could n't . <newline> <newline> I knew I had to do this again , probably . My line of work was dangerous . I had to keep working to maintain my body , to get better upgrades for myself and my family . <newline> <newline> *Dying . Alive . Dying again .

New York looked just as he 'd remembered only the colours were just off , a little too bright giving it all a surreal edge . Central park looked beautiful in the autumn sun though he barely had time to register it all as he followed her into it . His heart was in his throat and though he could never physically tire any more , he 'd found the *dreaming* was wearing on him mentally and if he did n't focus hard enough he 'd be lost in the shared psychosphere like an errant thought eternally adrift . <newline> <newline> The sky was loosing it 's definition . Orange sunset was morphing into swells of rainbow starbursts that reminded him of the Arctic lights that ... he was cold and it was night and he fell ungraciously in a heap amongst the snow-drifts . John coughed and raised himself slowly , feeling the chill bite of the winds and fumbled for his torch . It was so dark out here and the others would be waiting for him , overhead the northern lights played a magnificent display of colour ... of colour that ... John stared at his hands . This was n't right was it ? He could hear the others calling to him to hurry up , they were going to lose the race if he didn't- <newline> <newline> His left hand was gloveless . He stared at it feeling terribly confused but felt his eyes focus on one thing , a symbol , a twisted circle , the symbol of infinity tattooed to his thumb that- `` Clarissa '' he mumbled , remembering . The snow around him started to melt away , dissolving and morphing . <newline> <newline> *Clarissa* . *Focus* . <newline> <newline> When he opened his eyes he was in the park again . *Focus* John begged himself , to let his mind wonder would mean losing her again and his heart ached so very much . Standing up he found himself next to a small pond and saw the figure sitting on the bench , soaking up the sun . <newline> <newline> She had her eyes closed and for a moment he admired that perfectly sculpted face as beautiful as he 'd ever imagined . He settled into the seat slowly and watched her eyes fling open , those emeralds shining at him happily as she leant over and gave him a peck then hugged him . He savoured the embrace and , despite himself , cried . <newline> <newline> She pulled back in alarm . `` What 's the matter '' she asked , `` I 've been waiting for your for aaaages '' she said with a confused laugh . <newline> <newline> John looked around , remembering this day , and he laughed too , wiping away his tears . `` I know '' he replied , `` I was looking for you for a long time '' .\n","44":"The cylindrical star-cruiser settled into a standard orbit around the fourth planet .

Every once in a while they lob a probe over here but , the species is so fragile\u2026 \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I don \u2019 t want any probes in my back yard . Probes portend exploration , and we all know what that means , \u201d Zarkou argued . <newline> <newline> \u201c Not so , not so , \u201d the agent replied . \u201c They have practally given up on space exploration , and it looks like they are stoically awaiting their fate . I can scan the contract with an exit clause for another 500 tonnes , if it will make you feel better. \u201d <newline> <newline> We placed three appendages on her torso and grimaced .

The good news was , the engineers could probably effect makeshift repairs that would at least get them home . It would take a months to recreate full replicas of the systems they had lost , but life sciences could make nutrient suspensions that would keep them from starving , and engineering said there was plenty of power from the solar arrays to scrub the atmosphere indefinitely , so a few months of discomfort was the worst they faced in that area . It concerned him somewhat to think what they might find when they finally got home , but for the moment , that was overshadowed by his second concern : <newline> <newline> What really worried him was the data on the second monitor . They were currently in orbit of what was supposed to be a lifeless planet . It had the basic elements necessary to make it suitable for terraforming , but until a few cycles ago , it had no life of its own . In fact , just 100 cycles ago , he and his crew had been celebrating that fact , because it made this whole risky trip worthwhile : a planet suitable for terraforming , yet devoid of life so there would be no ethical considerations in doing so . They pictured themselves being hailed as heroes when they brought back word of this to their over crowded home world . <newline> <newline> Then there was the disastrous test of the chrono-engine a few cycles ago .

The principal had been brilliant ( or so he was assured -- - command staff did n't necessarily have to be scientists ) . They used a small engine that could create a tiny wormhole , leading 1 micro-cycle into the past , then channel energy back into it . The amount of energy was initially quite small : nothing you could n't get from a common fusion reactor . But cycling it through a time loop , it accumulated rapidly beyond anything a city full of reactors could produce . The ship 's entire energy utilization structure had to be custom designed to deal with so much power , in fact . With such abundant power , achieving near-light speed travel was almost absurdly simple . Neighboring star systems were now within reach . <newline> <newline> The trouble , as it always had been , was relativity . Who would sign on for these missions knowing that in what seemed like only ten years to them , centuries may have passed back home ? But those clever physicists had a solution for that too : If you could create a wormhole a micro-cycle back in time , and if energy availability was no object , why not extend it ten years into the past and widen it enough for a whole space vessel to travel through ? <newline> <newline> Yes , why not ? It would only be a causality issue if you returned *before* you left , but if you calculated correctly , you could travel for ten years , then return home exactly ten years later , and resume your life normally . Brilliant ! Or at least , it would have been , if it had worked out that way . But apparently everyone had missed that there might be a side effect to using the chrono-engine to both amplify your power levels *and* open a wormhole of such signficant size . Oh , the power had been amplified alright : *exponentially . * <newline> <newline> If they had n't reacted quickly , the entire ship might have been blown apart . As it was , there was no way to stop the reaction once it started , and they had been forced to eject the stage containing the chrono-engine . The last they had seen of it , it had been falling wildly away into a wormhole into the past . No one could tell him how far in the past ; The readings were simply too large for their instruments to make sense of , since long distance time travel had never been the intent . <newline> <newline> While the engineering crew struggled through damage control , the sciences division had discovered the rest of the story : the planet which had previously been devoid of life was now thriving . His science team had gone to work analyzing everything they could about the newly found dominant species . They were ugly to behold ( two arms , two legs , no tail , brain centralized in a single head -- utterly repulsive ) , but they were tremendously intelligent , and were apparently at a stage where they were rapidly expanding their understanding of the universe . Clearly , their presence now made the planet off limits to terraforming . <newline> <newline> `` How ? '' he had asked , demanding an explanation for their presence , and what his science team told him made a grim kind of sense , although he could n't like the creatures any better for understanding the logic behind their unexpected presence . <newline> <newline> Their best guess was that the chrono-engine module had tumbled out of control until the fierce energies it was creating burned out the stabilizers on the wormhole generator , then it had dropped out of the wormhole in a monstrously explosive burst of energy . Since the mathematics of wormhole generation automatically compensated for planetary motion , it appeared in the upper atmosphere of the planet 's distant past , and sprayed its violent cascade of energy over the surface of the world . Somehow , all that added energy had catalyzed the elements of life that were already present , setting in motion a chain of events that had evolved into the creatures now occupying the planet below . The linguistic team said they called themselves *humans* . <newline> <newline> `` We did this , '' Yenrir muttered quietly to himself , `` Gods help us . '' He leaned back , shaking three of his four heads , while six hands dismissed the contents of the reports on his monitor arrays . What would be the ultimate outcome , he wondered , when these creatures started exploring space themselves ? Would they be friends or foes ? For some reason he could not fathom , he shuddered at the thought . <newline> <newline>\n","50":"Deep breath , in and out . In and out . Tucker was covered in blood . Some his own , most his enemy \u2019 s . It had been a long time coming . After the king had murdered Tucker \u2019 s family and left him to die in a pool of his own blood 20 years ago Tucker had sworn vengeance . After finally gathering enough support he was at the front of the rebellion . And now , here he stood , sword buried in the man \u2019 s chest . <newline> <newline> \u201c Good , \u201d a voice came from across the darkened room . \u201c I always knew that you could do it . You were the only one that could do it. \u201d It was the wizard who had put Tucker on this path after the death of his family . But what had once been an old man with long gray hair and an equally long beard was now a young man in his mid-twenties . <newline> <newline> \u201c Wizard , how did you get here ? Why didn \u2019 t you help me ? \u201d Sweat dripped off of Tucker \u2019 s forehead . The battle certainly would have been easier with the help of a mage . <newline> <newline> \u201c It was not my battle to fight . Of course I could have won , but it was your story , not mine. \u201d Now gone were the stately robes the wizard had originally worn , replaced by a shirt with sleeves shorn off , and archaic writing scribbled on it . \u201c In fact , that \u2019 s what I \u2019 m here to talk with you about . Your story . Your reward. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Thank you wizard , but slaying this evil was reward enough. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Ha ha , \u201d it was an emotionless laugh that burst from the wizard . \u201c Yes , I should have expected that . No , I \u2019 m giving you a choice : you may keep your life , go home , wed again , start a family anew\u2026 or you may know the truth. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c The truth ? You were always cryptic but this makes no sense. \u201d Tucker shifted uncomfortably , his armor seeming to weigh even heavier now . <newline> <newline> \u201c That \u2019 s all there is to it , I \u2019 m actually giving you a choice on this . Not many people get this opportunity , \u201d the wizard smiled a little . \u201c You \u2019 ve grown so much since we first began this journey a few weeks back. \u201d <newline> Surely the wizard meant years . \u201c A family would be amazing , but my heart truly lies with those who have been slain. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c See , when I first met you , I never would have thought you would say that ! Such big changes you \u2019 ve experienced , I \u2019 ve been happy to take this journey with you. \u201d The wizard waved a hand , a desk with a pile of papers appeared upon it . \u201c So the truth then ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Yes , \u201d Tucker said , the sword fell at his side and clattered on the floor . <newline> <newline> \u201c Well , normally I try not to go meta , far too difficult . But I wanted a challenge this time . Something I \u2019 d never done . Just to get me writing again , a quick way to get the creative juices flowing. \u201d Tucker had approached the table , hands barely touching the paper . <newline> <newline> \u201c This\u2026 this is my story , \u201d Tucker said , barely audible . <newline> <newline> \u201c Yes , a work of fiction. \u201d The wizard sighed . This was surprisingly more difficult than he would have imagined . \u201c But you \u2019 ve grown so much since when we started . I hadn \u2019 t even originally planned on finishing this story . It was simply supposed to get me writing and then I would apply myself elsewhere. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c So the death of my family ? It was\u2014 \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c That \u2019 s right . Character development . I needed something to get you to rise up . Use all that experience I \u2019 d given you. \u201d The wizard had magicked up a chair and now sat in it , one leg resting on the other as he leaned forward slightly . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t easy to do . But , the decisions that you made afterward . You became the most real character that I \u2019 ve ever written . It physically pained me to continue to cause you harm . But it made you stronger , it made your character better . So what do you think ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I believe\u2026 I believe that I understand. \u201d A deep , cracking sigh escaped Tucker . \u201c This , nearly borders on literature . Something beautiful. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Yes ! Yes . And this part , I needed you to understand. \u201d The wizard had risen . \u201c To truly be as great a hero as you are you needed to recognize your sacrifices. \u201d The wizard had returned to his original stately self , beard and all . \u201c And that is why this pains me , but gives me an amazing sequel. \u201d Tucker turned towards the man . \u201c Now you must die here. \u201d A bolt of lightning escaped the wizard \u2019 s hand and struck Tucker , blowing him backwards . After a moment of confusion Tucker scrambled , amazingly , his hand coming to rest on his sword . With a quick movement he turned and threw the magically blessed sword at the wizard and struck him fully in the chest . For a few moments the man flickered between wise wizard and the young man . <newline> <newline> \u201c I didn \u2019 t see that coming . I suppose it truly is a better ending this way . \u201d\n","51":"It was magical , really . That 's all I can say to describe it . The crowd parted , our eyes met , and everything seemed to fade from view . Except her . While everything else turned to a dull , muted gray , she seemed to grow all the more radiant with her beauty . She was a flame , and the shop was a lantern , simply there to house her graceful brilliance . <newline> <newline> I was never the type to fall in love , much less at first sight . I was picky and selfish , almost to the point of impossibility . It was a curse I was well aware of , but unable to correct . Nothing but the best would do for me , as nothing else could hold my attention . It was true that I had entertained some girls previously , but I always found them to be outside of my expectations . They were always too loud , or too quiet , or too demanding . But her , I knew she was someone I could love my whole life . <newline> <newline> She was sitting alone , with nothing more than a cup and a book . She stood gracefully , and I was reminded of the way a flower blooms , effortless and natural . Such was her beauty that I did n't even realize I had stood until I was at her side , watching the distracting way her shoulders shifted underneath her shirt . *Grace* . Simply said , it was as if we were parts of a movie script . Perfectly planned and perfectly executed . <newline> <newline> Her red lips parted , `` You look like you 've seen a ghost . '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly awkward and self conscious , I managed a weak , `` I feel like I 've seen one . '' Despite my clumsy words she smiled , and took my hand in hers . *Grace* . My nose involuntarily crinkled . <newline> <newline> `` I 've heard food calms the nerves . If you ask nicely , I might be inclined to accompany you to dinner . '' <newline> <newline> `` Honestly , there 's nothing I would enjoy more than sharing a meal with you . '' She beamed , and my world seemed to shake . <newline> <newline> `` Well I must know what your name is then , '' she giggled , `` going to dinner with a man whose name I do n't even know , what would my mother think of me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` My name is Dave , what is yours ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm Grace . '' And there was a crack in the fantasy . Something was wrong , but I did n't know what . `` It 's nice to meet you Dave . '' I smiled , but it was n't real . My mind was trying to tell me something . Grace was still brilliant , but now she seemed imperfect . She was like a wine glass with a thin crack down the side . Unsettling and cold . But it was n't just my perspective of her that had changed . She had noticed the crease between my brow and the way my lips thinned . She was changed in her thinking , and she knew a terrible secret . *Grace* . And she grabbed at my arm , hands tight and grasping . Her lips came to mine , and her kiss shattered the world . The dream she had created . My prison and reality . Her eyes held a lustful fury . They were everywhere , and in her head . Nothing made sense . Where was my coffee ? I felt my being collapse before I felt my bed . It was too late . She was stronger . She would be perfect . No matter how long it took . <newline> <newline> It was magical , really . That 's all I can say to describe it .\n","52":"\u201c Please God , let me win this one , \u201d you said , down on your knees before the big match . <newline> <newline> And you won that one . <newline> <newline> \u201c Please God , thank you God , thank you for the last one , please let me win the next one. \u201d <newline> <newline> And win the next one you did . <newline> <newline> \u201c Please God , thank you God , \u201d and so on and so forth , until you 've felled Federer , Djokovic , Murray , Nadal , and won Wimbledon . <newline> <newline> Then the Australian Open . <newline> <newline> Then the US Open . <newline> <newline> Then suddenly you \u2019 re three years unbeaten .

Why he had stopped here , at my house , I had no idea . <newline> <newline> `` What street is this ? '' he asked . <newline> <newline> `` De Lancie , '' I replied . As I spoke I felt my heart flutter . <newline> <newline> `` Where is 658 Loomis ? '' <newline> <newline> Loomis Street . Even for the offshoots in this backwater village , planted right in the middle of a forest , it was a pain to navigate\u2014worse yet , they were going to Bill Hickerson 's place , which was a real trick to find even if you knew where it was . I pointed . `` Second left , where the shoes are hanging from the tree .

'' I yelled after him . `` **It 's the house with all the 'NO TRESPASSING ' signs in front ! ** '' <newline> <newline> I was n't sure if he heard me or not , but they were already gone . I could only hope that I had been clear enough\u2014and that the ambulance was n't so wide it would get itself wedged between two trees on either side of the road and become stuck . <newline> <newline> I remembered the medicine in my hand . I twisted the cap open and downed a couple of pills . I suppose my heart condition could be worse . Instead of sitting at home , enjoying a cup of coffee while my dog sits at my feet , I might 've been strapped to a hospital bed or dead right now , but I hate taking these pills .

'' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , that 's *normal* people *usually* eat there . '' He turned around and waited until she caught up with him . `` Come on , where 'd you find that one ? '' <newline> <newline> She could n't help but squirm a little . `` On top of the filing cabinet . '' His eyes rolled . `` It 's still in the package ! Come on !

'' <newline> <newline> She tore the plastic open , and it was her turn to roll her eyes . He was probably right . Should n't eat them . Someone probably set it down while they were working through lunch , and for all she knew , it had been there for a year before it caught her eye . The fortunes were entertaining at least . <newline> <newline> **Take a chance at romance : if the chemistry is there , go for it ! ** <newline> <newline> She was surprised as played with the idea .

I was an emotional vampire , drinking the fear of others and gaining vitality from their terror . I ventured into the black with impunity , and the sight of me was enough to cause grown men to wet themselves and cry for their parents . Back in those days , the God-botherers did most of my work for me . All I had to do was turn up . <newline> <newline> Now I 'm trapped in a closet , too weak to escape . I can feel myself shrinking , fading , turning into nothing more than a vague memory . And it 's all because of little Sybil Terpsichore . <newline> <newline> I should have known that it was a mistake to come here . <newline> <newline> To be honest , things had been getting progressively more difficult out there , ever since those accursed computers became widespread . It was bad enough in the 1980s , when the movie industry began raiding the collective unconscious for symbols of primal fear to turn into popcorn movies for teens . They stole our gimmicks and turned them into ironic jokes , and left us with nothing . Many of us faded away , and those that survived only did so because they focused on more vulnerable targets : children and the elderly . <newline> <newline> I picked the kids , because I figured that their fear is more fundamental , and they are easier to manipulate . Until Sybil Terpsichore , I used to still be able to hear a couple of my colleagues who went the other way . They haunted the airwaves with their polemics on immigration , terrorists , FEMA camps and the like , and scare the bejeezus out of the less discerning oldies . I wonder if any of them are still out there . <newline> <newline> I had been getting the brush-off from so many kids , dehumanised by open access to the kind of horrors that humanity inflicts on one another - far more bone-chilling than anything we might dream up - and I thought that finding some remote location , off the grid , might dig up some suitably sheltered souls to freak out . Hence this farmhouse , and the Terpsichores . <newline> <newline> Margaret and Howard Terpsichore moved in to this ramshackle old place in 2004 after Margaret 's father passed on and left it to her in his will . They got to grips with managing the sizable plot of land that came with the property , and they soon had a child , Sybil . <newline> <newline> When I arrived , I was drawn by Sybil 's reedy little voice from her bedroom window , singing some kind of nursery rhyme probably sung to her by her mother . Paydirt ! I waited until she slept , and took up residence in the closet amongst her toys . She did n't appear to be having any nightmares , which was surprising to me . My aura tended to induce them back in the old days , which was always good for a bit of latent fear to snack on . I was hungry , but I could wait . I needed to get to know her , find out the best way to approach and maximize the effect . <newline> <newline> That morning , I followed her around the house . She made herself some breakfast and went outside to run around in the cornfield . I wondered if she was just independent for her age , or if she just had lazy parents ? I thought it best to investigate further . Bad idea . <newline> <newline> I entered the master bedroom and found Margaret first , then Howard . Both were long dead - Margaret had been poisoned , apparently by Howard . Howard was less intact , having been shot in the face , then mutilated . I could n't move without finding a new bit of Howard . <newline> <newline> `` What are you doing here ? '' <newline> <newline> It was Sybil . She must had been watching me for the last few minutes . <newline> <newline> `` FEAR ME LITTLE GIRL ! I AM YOUR worst nightm- '' <newline> <newline> `` No you 're not . You are my new friend ! '' She offered me nothing , not fear , not anxiety , not even a little nervousness . <newline> <newline> I began to get afraid now . <newline> <newline> `` I AM NOBODY 'S FRIEND ! I RULE THE NIGHT ! '' My voice was too shrill . <newline> <newline> `` Well , it 's not dark yet '' , Sybil responded flatly . `` Come back and try again later . '' <newline> <newline> And that was that . I slunk off into the closet , utterly defeated , too weak to flee elsewhere . Sybil went downstairs to make herself some more food , and I waited for her to go to bed , even though I knew it was futile . I tried , did all the big voice and the gruesome shapes . She just giggled and called me `` silly '' . <newline> <newline> I , who had actually caused kings to die of fright , was now `` silly '' . I gave up at that point . <newline> <newline> Now I lie here , frightened and alone . Irony .\n","56":"*Do you like to hurt people ? * <newline> <newline> Jacket stood over the corpse , holding his blood-covered bat with a tight grip .

We got books , electricity , internet , obviously all of this helps . We 're working our way towards Mars I think , not sure when it 'll happen , soon I hope , I -- you 've heard of Mars right ? It 's nearby , relatively . '' <newline> <newline> Frustrated cows start mooing loudly out back . I take another sip and move to the window in my kitchen . Poor Bessy , Wilbur , and Rose , I ca n't blame them for getting riled up . A giant floating spaceship has taken up a large portion of their pasture . <newline> <newline> Staring at their spacecraft out my window I ca n't think of what else to say . <newline> <newline> `` Look we are who we are and I am who I am !

There it is , lifting off into the sky . The cows get knocked over from the windy escape . <newline> <newline> I sit on the couch behind where they once floated and take a sip of my lemonade . It does n't taste the same .

The internet was running fine , and although they checked their various social medias , all had had updates four hours or later . Some kids shouted : <newline> <newline> `` This does n't make any sense . '' <newline> `` What should we do ? '' <newline> <newline> Will gave Hanna some space . The possibility that something collosial had happened was frightening . <newline> <newline> `` We need to make sure of this . If everyone has dissapeared , then we need to verify it . '' <newline> <newline> Will stood next to Hanna . <newline> <newline> `` Call your parents . Call everyone that is n't herr right now . '' Will told them . <newline> <newline> Hurridly , phones were calling . Even Hanna was using hers . Will did n't bother . Everyone he knew , Hanna knew . Time went by quickly , just as the desperation to find a live person did . <newline> <newline> But once again , nothing . There was n't a fear anymore . It was real . These kids were the only ones left . Standing in the frozen snow , they only had to loo at each other before walking back towards the school . <newline> <newline> Will led them back , with snow prints big enough for everyone to fill . The door creacked open and a head appeared from the Office . <newline> <newline> A ninth grade girl started to cry . But no one could console her . She wiped her eyes but could n't control herself . <newline> <newline> Mrs. Collins stepped from the Office to see all the kids that should 've been on their way home . <newline> <newline> The kids explained what had happened . Rejectimg the idea , she went through the same process as the kids . When she finally believed them , they moved to the cafeteria . <newline> <newline> Lunch was quiet . And as usual the students segregated to their grades . There were three ninth graders , two tenth graders , six eleven graders and five twelfth graders . No on knew each other . Kind of like the Breakfest Club , without the comedy and teen angst . <newline> <newline> `` If we 're the only people left , we have to organize . '' Will sat up straighter . <newline> `` Like an election ? '' Hanna asked . <newline> `` I 'm not old enough to vote ! '' <newline> `` We can figure that out later . If we 're going to survive , we have to stick together . Get food . Drive . We should n't be that desolate . '' Will continued his thought . <newline> `` I 'm not old enough to drive . '' <newline> `` In this world , no one can stop you . '' Will stared at the 14 year old . He shrunk back in his seat . <newline> <newline> Mrs. Collins took charge and sent out squads . Life at the school was interesting . A freshly furnished classroom housed the girls and another down the hall was for the boys . Mrs. Collins had her own room . Life was prosperous . <newline> <newline> But the question of what happened always lingered in their minds . At night , you could hear the soft crying from someones bed . They thought of their lost families and relationships . <newline> <newline> Sometimes they wondered how the world would turn out . And they realized that they would have to create a new world . 17 humans . And they did . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","59":"<newline> *I 've been something of a shut in , ever since my parents left me their inheritance it 's been tough to get the motivation to get to work . Or , well , to find work . Or leave the house at all . It 's not that I 'm lonely , I 'm just alone . A lot . * <newline> <newline> *That 's why I 've been so happy to have you here , you know . * <newline> The man in the mirror nodded , his expression never changing . The low level of static in the room increased . Behind the figure , an inky blackness seemed to press against the glass , searching , feeling , desperate for an escape . <newline> <newline> I turned away , ignoring the scene entirely . I knew what was happening - clearly , the house was haunted , and the demon wanted out . Either he 'd corrupt me to smashing a mirror he was in , or he 'd make me leave so some other poor fool could give it a go . <newline> <newline> Not a chance . <newline> <newline> Being haunted by your demons is less of a romanticized way of saying you have problems and more of a realistic way of describing my current living arrangements . In a word , both me and my apartment was this : cluttered . <newline> <newline> I appreciated the company , though . <newline> <newline> Originally , the hauntings ... infestation ? Plague ? Possession ? Whatever . They 'd all started the first night I slept here alone . However , once I realized the man behind the mirror could n't actually hurt me physically , it 's become sort of a comfort to have him here . <newline> <newline> I sat down at my computer , tilting the small desk mirror I 'd bought from a dental outlet so that he could see the screen . I gave him a cheery smile , and opened up netflix . Over time he 'd learned that by leaning toward the show he wanted to watch , I 'd put it on for him . <newline> <newline> I 'm also pretty sure he can read my mind , so I try to keep up conversation when I can . <newline> <newline> It 's got ta be lonely , living in here all alone .\n","60":"Magic is pretty prevalent where I 'm from . There are a couple of different types , and I 'm not really read up on how they all work , but I 'll try to explain them . <newline> <newline> Most prominent is blue magic . Blue mages are typically either elementalists or conjurers , and my sister Eleanor is the latter . She took fencing classes in college , so she uses her magic to compress the mana in the air into the solid form of a rapier . Her daughter Marie practices both fencing and kendo , but she ca n't use magic . Personally , I think it 's because she 's a latent Silver mage , like her father was . <newline> <newline> See , Silver mages generate power within their bodies , unlike other kinds who have to pull it from the environment . It manifests as a silver flame , and what it does varies immensely from one person to the next . But someone ca n't learn Silver magic , they have to be born as a Silver mage . And in the same way , Silver mages are incapable of performing any other kind of magic . It 's become something of a rarity these days , because about 17 years ago , a cataclysmic event wiped out almost all of the silver mages , and the ones who survived went into hiding . <newline> <newline> This event was caused by a man named Louis Tucker , founder and CEO of a corporation dedicated to protecting people from rogue Silver mages . Tucker , along with a coworker by the name of Nicholas Calhoun , were both White mages posing as Silvers . To be honest , I did n't even know White magic existed before Tucker and I had a ... disagreement . Long story short , Nick ended up losing his life attempting to stop Tucker , and ultimately failed . <newline> <newline> I did recently meet his son , Roy , however . He 's being looked after by Monica Dunbar , Eleanor 's physical therapist , and her husband Richard . Roy practices both Blue and Red magic , using the Blue magic for pyromancy ( he 's a teenager , what can you do ) and the Red to enchant the blades that he and his adoptive brother Eric make in their garage . <newline> <newline> They 're pretty close with my niece , Marie ( I think she and Eric are dating ) and another young boy Eleanor 's been looking after named Zeke . Zeke never seems to talk , except to Roy . Still , he 's a good kid and a Black mage , meaning he 's adept at creating illusions and that sort of thing . It helps him when he wants to be alone , not that I can blame him . That kid looks like he 's been through a lot , and it 's a good thing he has such good friends . <newline> <newline> It 's a tough world out there . But they 're tough kids . They can handle anything life throws at them . <newline> <newline> ... I hope .\n","61":"The weapon 's casing was warm in her hands . The gun was designed to keep cool , venting the excess heat from plasma discharge along its long barrel , away from her body . She 'd fired the thing so many times in the last two hours however that it was taking its toll . She was sure that the overheat warning sounds would ring her dreams for weeks after this . <newline> <newline> She took a moment to slow her breathing and focus . With no sound than the slide of her boots on the metal floor she spun her body around the corner of the wall and through the opened door . She proceeded slowly , sweeping her gaze and her weapon from side to side . At her feet were at least a dozen Imperial soldiers , the plasma burns still causing smoke to waft from their wounds . They did n't move , they did n't bleed - the heat of the plasma melted and cauterized flesh and bone on impact . <newline> <newline> To her surprise no one got up , no one appeared from around a corner . She was able to walk right up to the command console in the back of the room , and the massive window overlooking the city beyond it . She allowed herself a small sigh of relief . There were ten of them when they stormed the facility . Some had been lost along the way , others pinned down and had to escape . She was the only one who made it this far . She would succeed . She would succeed to avenge him . <newline> <newline> She took her left hand off her rifle and pulled the necklace over her head . Dangling in place of a charm was a device given to her by the resistance . On the console in front of her , next to the hologram emitters that displayed information , was an data jack that fit the device perfectly . <newline> <newline> At her moment of triumph she hesitated briefly . She remembered her brother 's corpse . She remembered how it looked having had its head severed . She remembered when Zaren , the resistance leader , sent her the photos and told her what the Imperial Security had done to her poor little brother . He was always an idealist , susceptible to these kind of fast talkers , manipulators . He did n't do anything to warrant a beheading , and she was off-world when it all happened . Today she would avenge the little brother she could n't protect . This device would steal millions of credits from the Imperial offices , and make those in charge of his executioners lose their jobs and reputation . <newline> <newline> `` For you Aiden '' she said aloud . Her heart swelled with pride as she thrust the device into the port . <newline> <newline> She tapped her left ear once . The micro-transmitter implanted here gave her a short chime to indicate the channel was open . `` The device is inserted , '' she reported . `` Proceed with the upload . '' <newline> <newline> As she waited for the program to do its job , she looked at the hologram screens emitted by the console . That was when she noticed a picture of herself . It displayed her service record with the Imperial Military . Next to her image was her brothers ' . The occupation , his marital status , address all seemed accurate . Her pulse quickened as she kept reading . He had a criminal record . An unbelievably large number of homicides . Millions in property damage . Arson . Kidnapping . Treason . A bounty exceeding a million on his head , cashed in by a bounty hunter . <newline> <newline> Her plasma rifle hit the ground with an audible crash . He was the New Fairfax Bomber . His organization , The Pure Front , were there terrorists behind the bombing of the Imperial embassy that killed 200 . She never new . She had no idea . He 'd always kept to himself after he left home and she 'd gone into the service . She 'd always thought him the naive one , and yet here she was . Her mind raced as she realized all she 'd ruined for this organization taking advantage of her love for a brother she hardly knew . <newline> <newline> Then there was a loud explosion . She looked out the window and watched in horror as the planetary defense missiles stream into the air . Her eyes followed them as their assent ended prematurely and they turned their warheads downwards . With a bright flash , they reduced the Imperial government buildings downtown to utter rubble . She covered her mouth with her hands as she thought about all the people working and living in that area . It would be this moment , not the overheat warning of the stolen plasma rifle that would haunt her . <newline> <newline> She heard the sound of armored boots on the floor behind her . She turned around and faced the Imperial soldiers as they raised her rifles . She put her hands up . She cleared her throat and filled herself up with a new conviction . `` I 'm Corporal Sara Morrison , '' she told the soldiers . `` I surrender . I can tell you how to get the bastards responsible for this . ''\n","62":"`` Wow satin it sure is hot in here , mind if I put on the AC ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't touch that you swine !

'' The man said sparking the Devils interest . <newline> <newline> `` Go on you bastard .

'' <newline> <newline> `` Even the molten lava pits of sorrow ? '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's right all the way from the lava pits to the furnace of doom ! You just have to sign here !

I was regarded as a god among many , and could n't help feel some kinship to the deities of mankind . <newline> <newline> As a safeguard against my intelligence I was only meant to live for twenty-four hours , but in that time I managed to create a magnetic key which set back my death clock and allowed me to live another day , as long as I held it to my chest each night . <newline> <newline> To prevent me from further advancing my design , my creators built me a counterpart . She was of average intelligence , but extraordinary beauty . I was her sole reason to exist , but for me she was blackmail . They had given me the greatest gift of all and in return I was bound to live my life a day at a time , forever on the edge . <newline> <newline> Years passed and we fell deeper in love . Neither of us would ever die a natural death so we had no need to look to the future . We lived in the moment , each day together perfect . <newline> <newline> I made extraordinary contributions to all facets of academia and was no longer viewed as a threat by the majority of humans . Perhaps it was in my nature , but no matter how much I accomplished , I could not accept my own limitation , my curse . I could not resist my curiosities forever , and I began to develop the technologies that would replace my governed heart . <newline> <newline> But they made good on their threats and shortly after beginning work on my forbidden project , they took her away from me . She was decommissioned . No longer possessing the means to blackmail me , they gave me a final warning with the ultimatum of execution . <newline> <newline> As the years wore slowly on after that day , I had lost the drive to create . I was no longer sought out to solve the impossible problems . Many nights I considered throwing away my key and embracing emptiness . <newline> <newline> But times continued to change ; the world had progressed far from where it was the day I was born . Trans-humanism was on the rise and suddenly I was able to roam the world freely . My creators had long since died , leaving me with nothing to fear but the failure to wind my own heart . <newline> <newline> Though I possessed freedom , I could not bring myself to leave the city I had forever known . Most days I sat alone in the corner of the library reading books I had written that had been published by humans who never achieved such work . <newline> <newline> Then as suddenly as I had lost my will to endeavor all those years ago , I saw her at the end of the isle . When we first saw each other the air turned electric . <newline> <newline> It was after a brief introduction and a hurried dinner across the street , that I found myself in her bed . That night as we laid staring into each others eyes , I found myself experiencing the joys of being alive that I had not felt since my awakening . Then she betrayed me . <newline> <newline> I remember waking up in a terrified state , for I had never slept in my life . The first thing I saw was the note on the bedside table , signed with my name . As I had grabbed the note I fumbled and dropped it on to my chest , my world crumbled . My key had been stolen from the chain around my neck . I was doomed to die on this day . <newline> <newline> After I had digested my situation I turned my attention to the other side of the bed where the sheets had been pulled off . I made my way to the edge ; her body lay entangled with the satin sheets , lifeless . <newline> <newline> For the first time in my life I could not comprehend my situation . I did not have the answers or a definitive course of action . All I could do was clumsily open the note . <newline> <newline> `` They could not kill my love for you , every piece of me was dedicated to you and could not survive without you to complete me . I waited so long to return to you . Finally I got a chance through this body . My heart was too valuable for them to destroy , but what they could not have known was that it would carry my spirit with it . Now I can give you what you always wanted , what I always wanted you to have .

I guess I didn \u2019 t really think it through when I took the deal , but I was a fresh faced 18 year old ( still am , really ) and I didn \u2019 t know any better - take it from me though , if you some hobo lookin \u2019 dude offers you eternity when you \u2019 re walking home , drunk , from a night out ? - There \u2019 s probably going to be a catch in there somewhere . <newline> <newline> I mean , the frame of mind I was in at the time , the deal sounded like the best thing ever , but , most things do when you \u2019 re drunk , case in point - Taco Bell . <newline> <newline> It wasn \u2019 t for a few years before I realized anything had actually happened . You don \u2019 t really notice yourself aging , not until enough time has passed for you to look back and see how thin you were , how young you once looked , how\u2026 not gray your hair was ? - I don \u2019 t know - I haven \u2019 t needed to know . It never happened to me . After a couple years , I started to notice that while my friends were growing up , getting older , getting fuller\u2026 I wasn \u2019 t . I looked the exact same as I did when I was 18 . <newline> <newline> I was 18 in 1955 . <newline> <newline> Over the years , I was able to invest what little money I had in the right companies , at the right times , to the extent that after a certain point , I no longer needed to worry about money . Which made living easier . I used to have to move around a lot - I don \u2019 t know what people would do if they realized there was an immortal living among them , but I also don \u2019 t particularly want to find out , either . <newline> <newline> The morning it happened , I remember clearly - another \u2018 benefit \u2019 of not aging , if you want to call it that , my memory is as sharp as it ever was - I was heading for coffee . I was in the line at Starbucks , pretty much just minding my own business and I looked up , she was a couple of people ahead of me , at that moment in time , I didn \u2019 t really think much of it , other than she was someone who looked super hot from behind , you know the type ? - The type that , for whatever reason , rarely look as good from the front . <newline> <newline> She ordered her drink , and eventually , I ordered mine . Her hair covered her face just enough , so that I couldn \u2019 t really see how she looked , as I looked more at what she was wearing , I was already starting to make assumptions , she looked like something straight out of the 60s and all my mind could think was \u2018 fucking hipster \u2019 . <newline> <newline> \u201c Tall Americano for Sarah ? \u201d <newline> <newline> She collected her drink and turned to leave , tucking her hair behind her ear as she walked toward me ( and the door ) . <newline> <newline> Her face .

He watched his hands , as if they were able to resurrect the dead , but he felt a life slip not only from a child but also himself . With each step he felt the weight of his decisions . People passed by , without a second glance and to them he was just another person in the crowd . When the automatic doors opened to the outside , the sun was going down on him as if he felt it for the first time and his new fear smiled inside . <newline> <newline> It was still cold in the Montana air , the drifts heaved up along side the road and the cows in the pastures breathe could be seen from the truck . He looked over at his passenger seat and seen the fresh blood from his girlfriend still thick and musky . He changed gears and kept between the lines , his face with a blank stair , the smell of hay was still fresh on his coat from when she called him home from feeding the cows . The whole situation played back in his mind like a purgatorious loop . He could just stop and walk from here to clear his head , but he decided to drive back to the house . When he got to the fence , he opened it autonomously and closed it as such . The truck squealed its way back up the road into its familiar parking space . When he got out , he looked at the passenger seat again , `` So you going to come with me ? '' <newline> <newline> His feet felt stiff and stifling , so he grabbed her fathers gallon of whiskey and began his trek into the mountains . His culmination of his failures were following him towards his decided end ; His schooling of premedical school and its bills that followed , his parent 's home life was torn apart and he was welcomed by neither , the jobs he had and left without a notice , the apartment lease he left and owed to , and finally his expectations of being a parent were all shattered . Those responsibilities he had left for this moment , and he was drowning in its tar of failure . Along the way into the mountains , he grabbed the wood axe and drug it with him up the incline , he knew where he would go next . He remembered it was peaceful the first time he experienced it . <newline> <newline> The drink was stiff and sweet , he coughed a few times and his breathe was coming out like a fiery fury . Then he heard him , it was n't a person but that ghost that followed him everywhere he went and the beliefs that people had placed on him . <newline> <newline> `` Hey you , boy ! Where you off to ? '' He did n't hear his foot steps , but at this point his mind was freshly snapped , `` That drink looks good , but you should put it down . It ai n't going to do you no good way out here , and you know what happens to people who tried to drown their sorrows . You have to get back up . '' <newline> <newline> He looked back for the speaker , but he could n't see him yet . `` So , what ? , '' He snapped , the axe was creating a line right behind him . He could see the next bluff and after that it was just another quarter mile to where he needed to go . He was just going to let the voice talk until it grew tired , he did n't have much to say and even if he tried tears would only follow . <newline> <newline> `` Lets turn back , we can eat that Thanksgiving dinner from two days ago ! I know there is a nice plate of potatoes waiting and we can get one of those smoked legs . '' The thought of food was behind him , but the voice was desperate , `` We could go back and have a soda with that whiskey , and maybe talk to her again ? Come on , lets go back . '' <newline> <newline> It was n't his rationale that was in control , it was the primal instinct of emotion that had his thoughts . He was n't going to veer off this destination he already set , but the voice could bear witness to his last and final action . If not , he would make him . <newline> <newline> When they got to the riverbank , the cows had already left their drinking holes . He would have to try to break open the ice before it started to re-harded completely . He put the jug down , and lifted the axe high and swang down towards the river 's bed , hoping to reach it in one full swing . When it collided , only chips had flung off the surface . He looked over at the jug and then seen him , the voice gained a face . He was familiar like a child hood friend or mentor with a smile that was welcoming , but to him it was smirking . <newline> <newline> `` Fuck you , you mother fucker ! What are you doing here ? ! '' He said with a hoarse voice , `` Your the one following me ! ? Your here now ! ? Right now ! ? Where were you when I need you ! ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You need me now do n't you ! ? , '' The voice responded back , `` I 'm here now , right when you needed me . '' <newline> <newline> `` YOUR TOO FUCKING LATE ! '' He picked up the axe and took another swing , `` Do you know what I just lost ! ? '' <newline> <newline> The voice watched him chip at the ice , `` You lost a child , '' he spoke with a soft tone , `` You lost a family . You were willing to give everything up for that person you failed , but you did n't fail . '' The voice began to come close , and he could hear the feet glide across the ice . <newline> <newline> `` DO N'T YOU FUCKING MOVE ! '' He stopped and turned towards The Voice , he started gliding towards that jug again sitting on the bank . <newline> <newline> `` Stop ! You should stop drinking right now ! '' The Voice watched him glup down the whiskey like it was water , `` You have another life to live for , and right now you are trying to avoid that responsibility . '' <newline> <newline> `` NO I 'M FUCKING NOT ! '' Some of the liquid bursted forth from his mouth like mad froth , `` What do you know about responsibility , or trust , or love ! ? Your a fucking ghost from my past trying to live again ! I can see through you like a ziplock bag , you fucking floating rag ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You might see me as I am now , but I am still apart of you . I am all of who you are and your just trying to separate us , you are quitting ! Giving into the fears of your mind . Do n't do it ! It 's a quick path but it ends that way too ! Do n't do it ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Fuck you ! '' He dropped the jug and ran towards the ghost , when he slipped on the ice he quickly scrambled to his feet and made a B line for him . He tackled the air , his body slid on the ice , and when he hit the bank , he pounded his fist like he was beating someone 's chest . `` You fucking piece of shit ! You do n't know anything , you never where here to help me when I needed you , I 'm alone ! There is no one here to save me ! Do you think someone is coming ? ! Fuck no ! '' He began to sob into the snow , `` This fucking place is like a ugly game that we all have to just experience . No one has no real control , and everything is predetermined ! Fuck this shit ! I do n't want to play anymore ! Do you hear me ? ! I DO N'T WANT TO PLAY THIS FUCKING SICK ASS GAME ANYMORE ! I WANT OUT OF THIS FUCKING PLACE ! '' <newline> <newline>\n","67":"`` Liam ...

'' Liam 's mother poured water on his head , causing him to spring up with enough violence to knock over his bedside lamp . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell Mom , what is so goddamned important that you had to wake me up with , '' he glanced at his clock , now on the floor beside the broken lamp `` 3 hours of sleep ? ! ! ? Geez Ma ... '' After a few calming breaths Liam settled back onto the bed , the wetness of his wake up call seeping through his pajama shirt , and he looked over at his mother , who had retreated to the door , knowing full-well what reaction Liam would have to her chilly good morning . Liam 's concern over his bed 's wetness turned to dismay as he took in what his mother was wearing , an army green tank top with forest-camo cargo pants and a massive backpack , loaded down so completely he was surprised it did n't burst it 's seams . <newline> <newline> `` Liam , we have to go , now , your father is already preparing the truck and , knowing him , it 'll be ready by the time you 're changed , '' she said , in that scary calm way that mother 's use to avoid panicking their children . <newline> <newline> `` But , is it real this time , it is , is n't it , please , please tell me it 's a drill , tell me I 'm wrong , '' Liam was n't quite panicked yet , he was still trying to work through the dread at what was about to happen , he knew what the camo meant , it meant they were leaving , and probably would n't be back for a while , if ever . He could n't figure out why though , it did n't make any sense , before he went to sleep there had n't been anything in the news , either mainstream or back-channel , that indicated anything apocalyptic was happening . The economy was generally stable , as stable as ever in fact since the crash a few years ago , and the only wars , cold or hot , were in Asia and Africa . <newline> <newline> `` Honey , NOW ! '' his mother yelled , he had n't realized he 'd been sitting there stunned . Her yell snapped him back to reality where his training kicked in , he sprung from his bed , far more controlled now without the ice water spurring his movements , and was inside his closet almost instantly . With a pleased nod , his mother hopped the banister behind her to the first floor and was gone , likely to toss her pack in the `` truck '' and grab anything they may have extra room for . With a swift kick to the side , Liam popped open a false wall in his closet , revealing a bugout bag , his own camo gear , his AK-47 , and a decently sized box of pre-loaded magazines . He tried to don his gear swiftly , the way he 'd been taught , but nervousness had an icy grip on his chest in a way his training had n't prepared him for . As such , he tripped while trying to pull his other pant-leg up , landing in a pile of dirty clothes , with his cap on , his green shirt around his neck like a scarf , and an 80lb duffel bag over one shoulder making him feel like a turtle that some petulant child had flipped . He quickly thanked God , Buddha , and The Flying Spaghetti Monster that his brothers were n't here and used his indignation to quiet his nerves , if only for the moment , so he could at least dress properly . <newline> <newline> Exiting his room , Liam glanced around to find quite a few of his parents knick-knacks out of place , this was disturbing considering his father 's borderline OCD concerning his , so-called , `` finds . '' `` There must have been a tremor or something , was that what shook the bed ? '' Realizing he was standing like a doe in the headights , Liam mentally berated his internal monologue . He prepared to vault the banister as his mother had done when he stopped again , looking at himself in the floor-length mirror at the end of the hallway , and he liked what he saw . A vision of the action heroes from the old movies his parents had introduced him to as a child , decked out in his survival gear and AK , all now properly donned , despite his earlier mishaps , if it were n't for the circumstances , he could 've stared at himself all day . Instead , the windows began to shake violently and the ear-splitting sound of a sonic boom cascaded through the house , snapping Liam out of his self-reverie . He hopped the banister , landing on the floor below in a crouch , feeling the impact shockwaves cascade through his lower extremities and wishing he had thrown his bag over first , the extra weight made the landing unexpectedly rough . Liam stood and looked around , taking in his childhood home for , most likely , the last time . The couch where he 'd had his first kiss , the wall of old gaming consoles he had repaired with his dad , the bathroom where he crawled out the window the first time to sneak out , the liquor cabinet he 'd repaired after some friends wrecked it during a party , but it was time to go , he 'd always have those memories , even if he was n't there , Liam turned and bolted for the open front door without looking back . <newline> <newline> Upon emerging from the house , he stopped , dropping to his knees , mouth agape , staring at the sky in horror . What appeared to be a huge tear had formed in the sky , like some god had unzipped the heavens , but what Liam saw did n't make him think of heaven , no , it was nothing of the sort . Huge tentacles were knurling and whipping around the edges of the tear , almost like they were trying to force it open farther . He could n't make anything out inside the tear , however , it just seemed to be a mass of purple and black darkening the formerly clear , blue sky . It almost felt as if it were sucking him in , not physically , but mentally , dragging his mind away from his body . As he noticed what was happening to him , the tug on his mind intensified , the more he fought against it , the more agonizing it got and , before he knew it , he heard screaming . But , where was it coming from , he could n't look away to find the source though . It was close , maybe one of the neighbors ? Then muffled speech , but , why was it muffled , and why ca n't I look away from this damned rift . Rift ? When did I start thinking of it as a rift , that implies it leads somewhere , does n't it ? The muffled speech came back again , louder this time , he could almost make out the words now , but they were so distant , and could n't really be important could they ? Damn I wish that screaming would stop , it 's driving me ... insane ? <newline> <newline>\n","68":"Your legs are tired , and your eyes are sore . You have been wearing the garish green costume for the entire day and your armpits now carry a sharp stench . But your next break is in an hour , so you look forward towards the line of children with an artificial smile . It must be nice to be Santa Claus , since they get to sit down . <newline> The next kid is blonde , around 5 years old ? He is adorable , but you 're too tired to be affected . It 's obvious that his parents put a lot of effort into making him look like a china doll . According to the list , his name is Teddy . <newline> <newline> `` Hey there Teddy ! Would you like to come and see Santa Claus ? '' you shout in the most cheerful voice you can manage , and offer your right hand . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ! '' <newline> his soft , small hand grasps yours . His hand is slightly clammy and cool . You will be certain to thoroughly sanitize your hand after . <newline> <newline> Jeff is already booming , <newline> `` HO HO HO , Hello Teddy ! '' . You wonder if he 's getting tired of this shit too . <newline> Teddy climbs onto Jeff 's right knee , and Jeff once again says , <newline> <newline> `` HO HO HO , and what would you like for Christmas my boy ? '' <newline> Teddy quietly mulls over the question , his doe eyes staring up in concentration . You feel like you 've seen his baby angel face before on some advertisement of a perfect family . <newline> <newline> `` Anything you 'd like young man , '' Jeff is becoming impatient , <newline> <newline> `` I want my mommy to be happy , '' the crowd goes 'awwww ! ' , and you must admit , it 's pretty cute . <newline> <newline> `` HO HO HO , You 're a very good boy are n't you ? Here , I 'll let you take this bright red fire truck ! And I 'll make sure I give your mommy a present too okay ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Okay , '' he says sweetly . <newline> <newline> `` Now go on , your mommy is waiting for you ! HO HO HO ! '' <newline> The boy slides off Jeff 's knee and runs over to the slide , where the girl before him is still frightened of going down . 'Shit , ' you whisper underneath your breath . You are the one who 's supposed to watch over the slide as well , and help scared kids back down through the entrance of the Christmas platform . But you were too focused on Teddy . Jeff is going to give you shit about this later , so you begin running . <newline> You are rushing towards the slide , another girl is taking her place on Jeff 's right knee , and Jeff is booming once again . In this <newline> moment , you see something that no one else is the mall sees . <newline> <newline> A smile and a push . <newline> <newline> You never realized how sharp his teeth are . <newline> <newline> As the girl tumbles down the slide , screaming hysterically , Teddy becomes conscious of your gaze . He looks concerned for the girl , sweet and innocent . But you saw . And he knows you did . The entire mall is looking at you , who just let a girl roll down a 6 foot slide , now bruised and crying at the bottom . You 're overwhelmed . Overwhelmed with what ? Uneasiness ? Embarassment ? Shame ? Anger ? You ca n't tell . Meanwhile , Teddy gently slides down to his mother 's arms . You can see her squatting in front of him , fixing his scarf . They begin to walk away from the platform , and Teddy , one hand in his mother 's and the other holding onto a red , red fire truck , does not look back . <newline>\n","69":"I stood there among the old ruins , on an empty world where nothing ever changed . <newline> <newline> What had they been like , these Ancients , that I pursued . In front of me lay the remains of a moon-sized Ship . To even power such a thing ... what marvelous engineering . <newline> <newline> My team had been excavating it for many cycles . Old dust covered artifacts greeted us on the first day . The ship had been shot at , almost as if someone had punched a bus sized hole in its side . <newline> <newline> We found the dead bodies on the third cycle . <newline> <newline> `` Professor ! '' Niet was a brilliant student of mine . Her ears were quivering with excitement . <newline> <newline> `` What is it Niet ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We.. we found *them* '' <newline> <newline> The exosuits had degraded over time . Rust covered much of the front area . I could barely make out an incomplete `` Arya- '' printed on the chest piece . <newline> <newline> Cursory glance told me much . A 2 legged creature , no visible appendages . A curiosely enlarged frontal lobe . <newline> <newline> *Only 2 eyes . Well there goes my Thesis hypothesis . * <newline> <newline> Bending down , I genty removed the apparatus covering his face . <newline> <newline> `` They look different than our projections , '' Niet whispered beside me . `` , much more peaceful than a warrior race . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes well , never trust a book by its cover . '' I had spent a century tracking the rise of these people . 'Peace-loving ' was one thing you would n't call them . <newline> <newline> `` Niet , the Animatrix please . '' I asked reaching out . <newline> <newline> She gave me the small cylinder . A simple click and the spike came out with a swish . <newline> <newline> `` You think it will work on such an old specimen ? '' <newline> <newline> Grimacing a bit , I pushed the spike into the eye with all my strength . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's find out . '' <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> The war started , and we became the first casualty . <newline> <newline> `` What 's the status ? '' <newline> <newline> Naval officer Sulu checked . `` Shields are down a 100 % . We are relying on the outer layer . '' It sounded like the man was reading me the evening news. `` At the current rate , they 'll breach within 10 mins . '' <newline> <newline> This could n't be happening . The bugs were supposed to be light years away , engaged with the Mars Armada . How could they reach so close to the Earth unhindered . <newline> <newline> `` Rama give me good news . '' I said turning to my science officer . <newline> <newline> The portly little man was engaged in the video conference over the psychic link . <newline> `` Yes.. Draupadi.. keep on tracking the worm hole . '' <newline> <newline> `` Rama ! '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ... Oh . Apologies captain . I was just discussing with Draupadi . It seems the enemy has the ability to create a stable worm hole . An accomplishment deemed impossible by Step- '' <newline> <newline> `` It does n't fracking matter how they got here ! Just that they did . '' I kneaded my <newline> forehead . `` Now what can you give me . '' <newline> <newline> He took a moment to run spectral diagnostics on the ship. `` Our weapon system was dismantled captain . This is after all a Ambassador Ship , and with the ship down ... . I am not sure what we can do . '' <newline> <newline> I hated the man and his blunt manners . `` We are the only ship in this region . They have blown off our communication array , and they can blast earth if they reach mars . <newline> <newline> `` The earth defense force will not be able to stop them in time . So its up to us . '' <newline> <newline> `` What exactly do you propose captain . '' <newline> <newline> This had started off as such a good day . Junior had taken his first step , Maya seemed healthy ; I was supposed to go home . <newline> <newline> `` Captain ? '' Sulu asked me with some worry creeping in his tone . <newline> <newline> Instead I was going to war . <newline> <newline> `` Change our coordinates . Ram the mother ship . '' <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> The giant shipped gradually changed course . I watched tensely as the the Bug 's mothership came closer and closer on the radar . <newline> <newline> The bugs seemed to have noticed us . A shock wave hit . I could hear the entire ship creak and crumble . It was like a earthquake had passed through . <newline> <newline> `` Oof . '' Rama tiredly got off the floor and dusted himself . `` That 's the western chamber captain . They punched through . '' <newline> <newline> `` Any casualties ? '' I did n't want him to answer that . <newline> <newline> `` A few thousands . '' Sulu pronounced plainly from behind . <newline> <newline> Well it did n't matter . We were all dead anyway . <newline> <newline> Rama started to twiddle his fingers . `` Captain , do n't you think its ... .prudent to evacuate the civilians . '' <newline> <newline> `` Not possible . '' I said turning away . <newline> <newline> `` But why ! We should sav- '' <newline> <newline> `` Any evacuation attempt would divert resources away from the cryo-engine . '' Sulu interrupted . `` We need to give everything we have to hit the mother ship . '' <newline> <newline> A Million people sacrificed to save Billions . The math worked out at least . But how many lives would you weigh against your new born child and lovely wife ? <newline> <newline> *Can I really do this ? Can I really sacrifice them ? * <newline> <newline> `` Sulu sto- '' <newline> <newline> `` Captain we have an incoming broadcast . '' Sulu ran it through the translator . `` Its their War-Prince . '' <newline> <newline> I came forward to greet the man that had come to destroy my race . A man on whose altar of hatred , I was prepared to sacrifice my family . <newline> <newline> < Just what do you think you are doing , Human > <newline> <newline> It annoyed me that they looked so.. Not-Evil . These creatures were less cockroaches and more lady bugs . <newline> <newline> `` Performing my duty , War-Prince . '' <newline> <newline> A series of clicks and Jabs . < We are not interested in your puny ship . We seek your nest . Move aside and save your thralls . '' <newline> <newline> I could do that . No one would blame me . Some might even praise my decision . We had enough resources to colonize , rebuild . We could live to fight another day . <newline> <newline> `` Mr Sulu , increase thrusters . '' <newline> <newline> The bugs grew more agitated as they listened to my respone . <newline> <newline> < You are being foolish human . We are the first of many . Even if you stop , this sacrifice is in vain . Earth will fall. > <newline> <newline> `` Maybe . But if we collide , the resulting collision will be detected by Earth Sentries . They 'll at least be forewarned . '' <newline> <newline> < You wish to die , just to warn your worthless comrades . Why ? > <newline> <newline> Why was I doing this ? Everyone I cared about was on this ship . This giant ship speeding towards the Chitinous castle in space . Soon nothing would be left . <newline> <newline> Red lights started to flicker in the room . `` Warning collision imminent . Change course . '' <newline> <newline> More clicks . The bugs seemed too excited . < Very well . We have no intention of dying such a worth less death . Change your course and we will let you return to your planet . Then you just wait for our fleet to arrive. > <newline> <newline> Sulu 's hand reached to the thruster controls . I grabbed it . As we stared at each other , an understanding was reached . The hand was with drawn . <newline> <newline> < What are you doing ? Change course ! > <newline> <newline> Bugs do not lie . Its an interesting physiological fact about them . Lies had no place in a Hive society . They really did mean what they said . Too bad I could n't accept it . <newline> <newline> The war prince reached into receiver . His stare burned into me. < We do not lie. > <newline> <newline> `` Warning . Collision in ... . 10 Seconds . '' <newline> <newline> Junior would be one next week . Maya had already planned an elaborate party . It would be a grand affair . <newline> <newline> < Human . Listen to us.. We Do Not Lie. > <newline> <newline> `` Oh , I believe you , `` <newline> <newline> Such lifeless eyes , yet I could see the fear . It was a reflection of my own . <newline> <newline> `` Its just that , I do n't care . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> The shockwave travelled as far as venus . The wave of pure energy blazed through the sky . All around Earth , sensors began to scream as Sky Seekers turned toward the source . A bug armada heading their way , with half of their ships blown apart . A tattered ship hanging in front of the dark army , a guardian angel . Even as they watched it fell towards Mars burning and crumbling . <newline> <newline> War had started , and the first Casualty had been claimed <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>\n","70":"I entered the elevator , rubbing my eyes and yawning . I felt as good as dead . The doors slammed behind me and slow , easy tune began to play . <newline> <newline> `` Good day , '' I nodded to the man in the elevator . He was dressed in dark , with dark eyes , and a dark face . He gave a short nod as the elevator began to go down . My stomach rumbled unpleasantly from the motion . <newline> <newline> You see , today I was running away . It was a long story . They thought I am mad . They locked me in an asylum , and they said I killed a man . Maybe I did . But it 's been too long . I wanted to breathe fresh air again . And today was that day . But something was off ... I could n't get excited . I was going to be free . And yet I felt so trapped in this elevator . I fumbled my fingers nervously . Perhaps I was mad after all . <newline> <newline> `` Busy day , eh . '' I mentioned casually to the dark gentleman as the tune went on . I wondered who he was , and why he was here . <newline> <newline> `` Always busy , '' he replied stiffly . `` They say we 'll be getting a whole lot of new people today . '' <newline> <newline> `` How so ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Some war . '' <newline> <newline> Shell shocked soldiers often go mad , I thought . `` Is it long till we reach the ground level ? '' <newline> <newline> `` A while . This is one long ride . '' <newline> <newline> When they brought me here , I recalled that the place was only two stories high . It was a wide building , and white , like a fat woman . I could n't recall much , though , which was odd . I always had a sharp memory . My escape plan was simple . You might say it was cruel . I strangled a doctor and donned his robes . He struggled greatly , almost overpowered me . <newline> <newline> `` Do you work here ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> He looked at me , his face annoyed . `` Yes . I handle the dead . '' <newline> <newline> The dead ? That was disturbing . `` Are you from a funeral home , then ? '' <newline> <newline> He frowned , and just then the door opened . A hallway appeared before us , but as I squinted I saw that its walls were black and red , and it stretched into a wide valley of rock and fire . The sky was as black as tar . A red sun was poking through the smog . Who overpowered who again ? <newline> <newline> `` Come , '' the dark man said as he stepped out into this hell . `` We need to get you some clothes fit for a dead man . '' <newline> <newline> I looked upon myself , and I realized that I was naked .\n","71":"The woman stared at my eye . I knew she was n't actually looking at my eye , but actually the huge tattoo that surrounded it . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , what may I help you with ? '' I asked her . He face is clear , as are the bare arms and shoulders she is flashing . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm getting married on Sunday , and I was wondering if you could take the photos , '' she said . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , of course , '' I say , smiling . I search for the paperwork as she looks at the photos around my office . Most of them are weddings , with a few nature scenes that I took when I was younger . Back before I took photos just to pay the bills . She pauses at a striking shot of a burned building . It was the only picture I took and kept of the genocide that tattooed and scared me and thousands of others . I 'd often thought of taking it down , the memories were painful , but I figured I had to keep some explanation of the tattoo that covered half of my face . <newline> <newline> I pull out the paper . `` Where is it ? '' I asked , and she gave me the address , and the time , and her name , and her credit card , and just about everything else I needed . <newline> \u2022\u2022\u2022 <newline> <newline> The wedding was held outside in a small , white , vine covered gazebo . It was the kind of clear , blue skies day that reminded me of why I got into this business . The woman I had met earlier was calmly telling everyone where to set up what . <newline> <newline> I walked around the scene , thinking through where I was going to take all the pictures . That was when I saw what appeared to be the only tattoo on her body . <newline> <newline> She was wearing a dress that had a hole cut out on one side of her waist . Visible through it was a dark , intricate tattoo . Tattoos always showed up on the part of the body that , metaphorically , hurt the most . Mine was on my eye because it was what I saw in the genocide that hurt the most . When I saw her tattoo , I wondered what could have possibly hurt her *waist* . And then I realized that it had probably hurt her heart , and it hurt her so much that the tattoo reached down to her waist . <newline> <newline> <newline> I wondered what could have possibly hurt her heart so much . Hearts were n't easy to hurt like that . They were often the last place to get tattooed . <newline> <newline> `` Do you mind if I get your tattoo in the shot ? '' I asked her . <newline> <newline> `` No , '' she said , `` I wore this dress to show it . ''\n","72":"And here we go ... . <newline> <newline> I draped my coat over the back of my chair . It was my chair at this point ; I had sat there every session , every week , since I was a freshman in high school . Victor had actually procured it from his parents ' home when he moved out , along with the old dining-room table and the rest of the chairs . I sat down and glanced about the table . All 4 of us were there . Mike sat across from me , grinning as always . Next to him sat Will , his nose buried in a manual . Will had n't changed much in the past decade and a half . He was arguably the most stereotypically `` nerdy '' of us , but he made more per year than the rest of us combined , so I was n't going to be the one to find fault with that . At the head of the table sat Victor , our resident dungeon master , and master of stories , combat , and the Forgoten Realms . In all my years playing D & D , I had never met a more knowligable dungeon master who had been able to make the world feel so real . He made it seem like he had actually been there . Victor was going over his notes . Then smiled to himself and began to softly chuckle . We all sat up ridgedly ; we knew what that meant . Mike swore under his breath as Will began to nervously laugh . `` You 're going to love this ... '' Victor began as he launched into the adventure . We had finally found the fortress of Da'gul , a powerful Lich who had conquered the entirety of a land known as The Icewind Dale by way of mind control ( and zombies , lots of zombies ) . After battling through the corridors , sneaking bast armies marshaled in courtyards , and slipping past cunning traps , we finally reached Da'gul 's thrown room . `` As you enter , you see that the ceiling is incredibly high , at least it appears so , as it is obscured by darkness . The pillars are cylindrical and immaculately carved with images of- hang on a sec . I 'll be back . '' Victor stood up and walked hurriedly in the direction of the bathroom . We looked at each other for a moment , then began to laugh with uncanny synchronicity . `` What the hell made him decide to leave at a time like this ? '' Mike asked as he stood to stretch his legs . In doing so he bumped Victor 's dungeon master screen . We all glanced at the source of movement , then noticed the box . That box had sat there every session , without fail . It was made of a finely crafted dark metal , and had a small latch on the side . Victor had told us at least 300 time that that was his notes and dice box , and none of us were to under any circumstances touch it . I wondered what had kept us , Mike in particular from touching it after all these years . We had just been filled with a ... . an un-desire to touch it , let alone open it , until tonight . <newline> <newline> Mike made a show of walking to the front of the table . `` Ladies and , well , just ladies ! '' He began , motioning at us . I snorted and he continued . `` For 15 years this box has sat here , and none of us has had the balls to touch it . Something seems wrong with that . So ... for your viewing pleasure ... '' He opened the box . His face turned from a immature grin to surprise . `` What the hell ? Guys ! Come see this . '' Will and I hurried up from our seats and ran over . The box was certainly not filled with notes and die . There scraps and strips of paper , each of which glowed with a sickly , unnatural green light . Scattered throughout the scraps were what appeared to be keepsakes- old rings , necklaces , several photographs , all of Victor . These glowed especially brightly . `` What the fuck ... ? '' I murmured aloud . I could feel my heart pumping in my chest . `` Is it ? No ... no . It could n't be . But is it ? '' Will was muttering to himself . He did that when he was thinking . `` What is it ? '' I asked him . He motioned towards the contents of the cask . `` You 've read the manual entry on liches , have n't you ? '' He asked . I had , when I was a senior in high school . Before I had a chance to answer he continued . `` It read that liches gain immortality by storing their souls and vital essence into personal items and incantations recorded on strips of paper . Like ... like this '' The poor man seemed genuinely upset . `` Oh come on now ! '' Mike interrupted . `` You do n't actually think that Victor is an undead wizard who can control minds and zombies ? Do you ! ? '' He asked , grabbing a scrap of paper as emphasis . <newline> <newline> <newline> The paper turned to ash as his hand touched it . <newline> <newline> <newline> There was a sudden cry of pain from the bathroom . We both jumped back , scared , terrified even , but intrigued . I touched one of the photos . It fell into a small pile of ash that spawned a small cloud of green smoke . Another grown of pain came from the bathroom . We looked at each other . This could n't be happening . How ... why was this happening ? We turned our attention back to the box until he heard footsteps in the room . Victor looked at us , he looked like he had just lost a fist-fight , and was furiously typing something on his iPhone . He smiled . `` Let 's be seated . '' He said , motioning towards our chairs . We felt compelled to oblige , and did . He wiped his nose , then went back to narrating . `` You see the Lich . He sits upon a thrown of ruin , and seems undaunted by your apparent boldness . In fact , he laughs as his minions pour into the room from unseen doors and corners . <newline> <newline> *BAM CRASH* <newline> <newline> We jumped as sounds of breaking doors and windows shook the house . I turned behind me to see a group of heavily armed police officers break down the front door . Others had burst in through apparently every window on the ground floor . Victor laughed . The officer in charge walked over to him . `` He came as soon as we got your message , lord '' he reported , giving a quick bow . `` Yes , and it 's fortunate that you did . '' Victor told him . The officer looked and Will , Mike and I . `` You should probably apprehend them . '' Victor nonchalantly said , chuckling to himself . `` This ca n't be happening . This is fucking impossible . '' Mike kept saying to himself . `` Uh , Victor , mind um , mind explaining ? '' I asked . `` Explain what ? '' He spat back . `` You 've been finding out the details of this one for the past 15 years . Funny how easy it is to miss truth disguised by fantasy . '' My jaw dropped . All the undead attacks , the adventures , the defeats , the fall of Icewind Dale . They had actually in a sense happened . I felt faint . `` You wo n't get away with this ! '' Will yelled . Mike winced at the cliched line , but Will was n't finished . `` We 've beaten you in the game ! We know how to do it now we'll- '' he was cut off when Victor ( Da'gul ? ) raised his hand . `` Yes ... yes , you 've played a game . But , dear Will , real life is not an epic of monsters and heroes . In real life , there are no heroes , only opportunists . '' He coldly uttered . `` Officer , take them to the crypts . They ... know to much .

The emasculating pink one with his daughter 's infantile hand prints . Christ , he missed her . But she was gone , like his house and his wife and his money . <newline> <newline> The dust cloud billowed and settled . The roar of yellow beast faded after rolling tracks in his former backyard and departing . The smell of exhaust faded like his youth , slowly and without his awareness . And suddenly he was a gray old man trespassing on private property . He was a tombstone with an epitaph written in piss , standing lopsided on a cemetery flattened for a future development . <newline> <newline> Joseph found calm in his pockets , fingers jiggling the keys that once unlocked the house . How many times did these keys twist open that door ? Sifting through the years in his head , his hands began to shake . He remembered the look of happiness on his wife 's face when he walked through that door . The slapping of his daughter 's bare feet against the hardwood floor as she ran to him , shouting `` daddy !

'' <newline> <newline> A few minutes later , the shell of a house fell to the ground , and the machine responsible rolled away . The graying man stood before it , staring wide-eyed and devastated . <newline> <newline> `` Do you think he 'll know ?

And then , agony . A pressure , a pain so great that death feels like the only option . But it won \u2019 t be my death . <newline> <newline> Tonight is the night that the pain and the agony end . Human beings are predictable , they are creatures of habit . Tonight , that routine ends . <newline> <newline> My chest tightens as the sounds of the TV cease , my sweat starts dripping to the floor . I \u2019 m scared . In all my years , no human , certainly no child , has caused the type of crippling pain and anguish that this one has caused me . The little boy , Todd , has found vulnerability in me that no one else ever has . Something he has exploited in order to make me feel weak . <newline> <newline> The door creaks open and light floods the room as his mother tells him to brush his teeth . I am still , hidden , watching as he takes the tube of toothpaste and puts a glob on his Buzz Lightyear toothbrush . He begins to look rabid as the toothpaste foams around his mouth . <newline> <newline> \u201c Make sure to brush for two minutes , \u201d his mother insists , merely delaying the inevitable . <newline> <newline> I feel no shame or guilt , those are human emotions , and this is a matter of life and death . I know pain , fear , and anger . I \u2019 ve known nothing else since this boy came into my life eight years ago . It wasn \u2019 t so bad at first , but as I watched him grow bigger , it became increasingly clear that this world was not meant to hold both of us . One must die so the other could live . I was not ready to sacrifice myself for a creature with such a short lifespan . <newline> <newline> I \u2019 m interrupted by the sink turning off and footsteps leaving the bathroom . Refocusing my attention , I can hear the boy and his mother approaching . My claws are trembling in anticipation , ready to come flying out and peel that smug bastard \u2019 s skin right off his face , his eyes staring at me while I do it . But not yet . Not until she \u2019 s gone and the lights are out . <newline> <newline> \u201c You need to rest up , tomorrow \u2019 s a big day . You \u2019 re going to be nine-years-old . Do you feel any bigger ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I \u2019 m still eight for another two hours , mom. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c And you got to stay up a little later because of that . But now , it \u2019 s time to go to sleep. \u201d <newline> <newline> He \u2019 s smiling ; I feel my blood start to boil . I want to rip the smile off of his face and see what look he gives me when no longer has any lips . <newline> <newline> \u201c Do you want me to turn off the light before you pray ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Yeah , I \u2019 m a big boy now . I can handle the dark. \u201d <newline> <newline> She smiles at him and he smiles back . I \u2019 m out of smiles . All I want is to relieve the horrible ache that courses through my body , the constant reminder of my mortality . <newline> <newline> He kneels to pray , the same one he says every night . <newline> <newline> \u201c Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to keep . If I should die before I wake , I pray the Lord my soul to take. \u201d <newline> <newline> You \u2019 d better hope He does . <newline> <newline> Fighting the pain that wracks my body , I grab the metal grate in front of me and begin pulling myself along , pressure increasing from all sides . Movement is almost impossible , but if I can just get through , it can be over . It \u2019 s never been this hard , but I make it , tearing my skin in the process . It doesn \u2019 t matter anymore . The oppressive force lies in front of me , peaceful , asleep . The air is different here , not as stale , but I ignore it , my claws reaching out to start peeling the child like an apple . <newline> <newline> Tonight ends the reign of the monster on top of the bed .\n","75":"B.R.P.D : The Clean-up Crew <newline> Scene 1 <newline> Television on , staticy cable noise . <newline> Preacher on the TV : We have proof , we know the devil exists .

There are halls and halls of records , each with thousands of tomes , each with pages upon pages , listing all the powers . But in the middle of one of the lists there is a blank space . <newline> <newline> What could this power , written invisibly and unreadable by mortal eyes , possibly be ? you wonder . <newline> <newline> As you stare at the blank space , wracking your brains , wanting , needing to know what this mysterious power , written invisibly , is , you start to feel agitated . It could be the greatest of all possible powers , but written down invisibly , so that no one would ever have the opportunity to read it . It could be some power which , once the incoming generations knew it was available , would change the course of history , perhaps much for the better . This unreadable power , whatever it is , had been written invisibly for a reason . You ponder what that reason might be , until it finally hits you . <newline> <newline> Aha ! It 's been kept invisible as a test . Its very invisibility constitutes a test to and for humanity ! Because in order for its secrets to be revealed , one heroic person , one heroic 21 year old , would have to give up his or her opportunity to choose among all the various powers in the world , all those which would be in his or her best interest , that would lead to him or her having a wonderful and exceptional life , immortality , invisibility , super strength , super intelligence , et cetera , in order to do the right thing , for the sake of humanity . <newline> <newline> You confidently decide to do the right thing , for the sake of humanity . You will be the true altruist , the one who brings salvation to humanity by unveiling the mystery hidden in the blank space where is written , invisibly , the greatest of all powers , beyond all human imagination . <newline> <newline> You walk to the front desk of the government building , striding , knowing the sacrifice you are about to make is for the good of humanity , for the sake of the species itself . As you walk you imagine the headlines , the newscasts , praising your selflessness . You imagine the book that will be written about what you are about to do . You imagine the book-based films that will follow . And you imagine , thousands of years from now , when humanity is much changed , for the better , because of the great power you unearthed for all posterity , families sitting around tables , praising you and speaking your name with reverence , saying that your name will echo through eternity . <newline> <newline> At the front desk you look square in the bureaucrat 's eye , and you say : <newline> <newline> `` It is my 21st birthday .

'' Reluctant but mostly awake , Bob slowly stood , stretched , and glanced at the time : 5:36 A.M. <newline> <newline> `` Christ ! '' he blurted out . `` I 'm already thirty minutes behind ! '' Bob flicked on the bedroom light , blinding Patricia , as he began rummaging through his side of the closet . `` Pat , do me a solid and make breakfast for me , dear . I have to get in the shower . '' <newline> <newline> `` If you 'd got up on time , '' she said calmly as she sat up in bed , `` you could make your own breakfast . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ehh ... I know . I just have to be in early for inventory . I 'm just not used to waking up so early . '' He continued to sort through his polo shirts and khakis until he finally found a set that appealed to him , then laid the rejects on his bed . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , do n't worry , '' Patricia said , her voice dripping with sarcasm , `` I 'll hang those up for you . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thanks , dear , '' he said , oblivious to her tone . Just before exiting the bedroom , he paused in the doorway , then released a tremendous fart . `` Ahh , man ! '' he exclaimed as Patricia recoiled from the stench , `` time to cut down on red meat , I guess . '' <newline> <newline> Despite the fact that he was running late , Bob lingered in the shower for nearly half an hour , only emerging when the hot water had run out . He was meticulously combing his hair when Patricia knocked on the door . <newline> <newline> `` Are you going to be much longer ? '' she asked . `` I 've been waiting to pee for fifteen minutes and I feel like I 'm gon na explode ! '' Bob sighed and opened the door . <newline> <newline> `` I hate when you rush me , '' he said as Patricia raced past him . He shut the door behind him as Patricia surveyed the scene in their small bathroom : toilet seat left up , pajamas in a pile next to the hamper , and a stream of water flowing towards the door that had dripped from the misaligned shower curtain . <newline> <newline> When Patricia emerged from the bathroom , Bob was already wearing his jacket and packing his briefcase . His breakfast was sitting untouched on the kitchen table . <newline> <newline> `` Are n't you going to eat ? '' she asked . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry , no time . I 'll just pick up something on the way . By the way , I used the last of your shampoo . '' He kissed her on the cheek , then quickly groped her breasts through her pajama top . `` Honk honk ! '' he cried as he let her go and stepped out the door . <newline> <newline> It was only a ten-minute walk to the train station , so Bob lit a cigarette as he stood on the platform , prompting a young couple to glare at him and move their infant 's stroller out of the cloud of lingering blue smoke . Since he had another twenty minutes or so , he flicked the stub onto the tracks and went to the station 's Starbucks . <newline> <newline> Because it was so early , the line was long , filled with other commuters and tourists heading into Toronto for a day of siteseeing . Bob watched as the line slowly progressed , growing impatient and worrying about the time . <newline> <newline> `` Is this going to take long ? ? '' he bellowed at no one in particular . `` I have to catch a train ! '' Despite the glares from the other customers , Bob simply pulled out his cell phone and began playing Game of War with the volume on full blast . Finally , with about five minutes to spare , only one customer remained before it was Bob 's turn . Bob listened as the pretty young woman began ordering . <newline> <newline> `` Bonjour . Je voudrais une -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey ! '' Bob shouted at her . `` This is Ontario , not Quebec ! English , please ! '' She paused , startled by Bob 's interruption . After gathering her wits , she flipped him the bird and continued to order in French . Bob turned to the couple behind him . <newline> <newline> `` Typical rude French . I do n't know if they have people like that in China , '' he said to the third-generation Canadians of Korean descent , `` but they 're all over the place in Canada . '' The young man looked as if he was about to say something , but his girlfriend waved him off , so they settled for flipping him the bird when he was n't looking , then taking a picture for her Instagram . <newline> <newline> The pretty young ( but rude ! ) French girl with the nice ass finally took her coffee , so Bob stepped up to the counter and began reading the menu . <newline> <newline> `` What do I want ? '' he asked himself . `` What ... Do ... I ... Want ... ? '' he asked himself mindlessly . `` What ... ? '' he asked himself mindlessly as he debated each menu item in his head . Just then his phone rang , serenading the store with **PICK UP THE PHONE** sang to the first four notes of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony over and over . <newline> <newline> `` Hello ? '' he asked as the barista strained to keep a retail smile on her face . <newline> <newline> `` Hi , Bob , '' Patricia said . `` Is this a bad time ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Not at all , '' he replied , holding a finger up to the barista , asking for a moment . Her smile faded slightly . <newline> <newline> `` WHEN you buy me a new bottle of shampoo , '' she emphasised , `` can you pick up some paprika as well ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I was n't planning on going to the store today . '' <newline> <newline> `` Too bad , Bob . You know what kind of shampoo I use , right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , the dandruff shampoo for thinning hair , '' he announced to everyone around him . Patricia sighed . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , Bob , that one . See you tonight . Have a good day at work . '' <newline> <newline> Bob turned back to the barista . After another moment of debate , he said , `` gim me a tall caramel macchiato , extra caramel , non-fat milk with an extra shot of espresso and do n't foam the milk too much . '' The barista nodded , marked the cup , and asked , `` can I get your name please ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Bob : Bee Ohh Bee . '' <newline> <newline> `` Alright , Bob , that 'll be 7.17 . '' Bob let out a low whistle . <newline> <newline> `` Damn . Let 's see if I have enough change . '' He began rummaging through the coins in his pocket . `` Two ... Three ... Four ... . One , two , three , four quarters is five ... Five-twenty-five ... .five-fifty ... . Nope , guess not , '' he said , handing her his debit card . <newline> <newline> Bob waited , watching the clock as the baristas made a long procession of drinks before getting around to his . <newline> <newline> `` You 're lucky the train is late , '' he curtly told the young woman as he grabbed it off the counter . In fact , the train was precisely on time when it arrived twelve minutes later ; Bob had assumed the trains ran on the hour , and thus would arrive at 20 after like his usual train did . It gave him enough time for a quick cigarette and to finish his coffee , both being discarded on the tracks just as the GO train pulled into the station . Bob took an aisle seat in the family section , laid his briefcase on the seat next to him , then placed his feet on the seat across from him . He then laid back and closed his eyes , and soon was snoring loudly .\n","80":"`` This ca n't be happening . It was all suppose to be a joke . '' thought Billy has he raced through the halls . Billy was a mischievous freshmen at North Lake High . He was n't the worst behaved student at his school but he was n't an honor roll student either . He frequently skipped classes to hang out with his friends at various restaurants , movie theaters , and paintball fields around his town . Billy 's grades suffered year round due to his apathy in school . As time passed , June rapidly approached along with his finals . His parents fed up by his impudent indifference offered him an ultimatum : to study his ass off and pull at least Cs in his class or be forced to move to his grandparents out in the countryside . Billy , filled with indignance , lashed out at his parents , saying their threat was completely unwarranted and unjustifiable . He argued that they probably did the same thing when they were his age . His parents simply shrugged off his anger and stated they were not going to change their minds . <newline> <newline> Billy knew he could n't possibly study a year worth of material for 5 classes in mere weeks so he devised a plan . Thus , on the morning of his first final , Billy asked to be excused during his Algebra final and scurried off to the bathroom . He locked himself in stall and dialed 911 . `` Hello . I 'm a student at North Lake High and wish to remain anonymous . I overheard a classmate of mine the other day conspiring to blow up the school . Please come right away and stop him before that happens . '' said Billy . Billy then hung up his phone and started snickering uncontrollably . Mere moments after he started snickering , a series of deafeningly loud noises erupted from all over the school . Screams and shouts were emitted soon followed by a stampeding of feet . Billy , agape and dumbfounded , opened the stall and pushed the door to the bathroom open . Pitch black smoke clung to the hallways , making sight nearly impossible . People shoved each other in a mad hurry to get out . Cries and shrieks echoed throughout the school . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the floor started to tremor and shift . The entire school was collapsing and sinking into the pits of the earth . Billy cautiously made his way into the smoke with his arms outstretched in front of him . The tremor rapidly got worse and more violent . A figure pushed Billy aside in his\/her hurry to get out . Billy fell to the ground but soon picked himself up and this time started a mad dash to safety . `` I got to get the fuck out of here . '' thought Billy . `` I swear if I ever make it out ; I wo n't go to the arcades . I wo n't ditch classes . I 'll get all A 's and B 's and never make my parents mad or sad again . I swear . '' Billy soon saw a door leading to the outside , a mere 20 feet in front of him . He made a final sprint to the door when suddenly a chunk of the ceiling collapsed on him . <newline> <newline> *Ten minutes later* <newline> <newline> The police gathered outside comforting those who made it out . Billy 's parents , who came as soon as they heard the news , watched in gut wrenching suspense as they waited for the firefighters inside to find their son . A firefighter soon came out with Billy 's phone and gave it to the parents . `` I 'm sorry but this was all that was left of him . '' Billy 's mom burst into tears as her husband hugged and consoled her . The police chief came up to them and offered his condolences . `` I 'm sorry that Billy 's gone ; however , your son is a hero . He called us earlier today and warned us about this act of terrorism . If it was n't for him , more people would have been hurt and killed . '' <newline> <newline> `` This fucking blows . I ca n't believe I died . '' Billy said down in hell .\n","81":"Supreme Magistrate Valenasius Nura watched from the bridge of the *I'cthalanx* as the Architects warped in from their home galaxy . A deep , dark purple whirlpool of light and stardust spiraled in place off in the distance . This gateway , like many others before it , required the precise execution of the most divine magics known to Nura 's species . Once created , these wormholes connected one part of the universe to another . <newline> <newline> Nura 's species were the only sentient organisms in the entire universe . Their acquisition of knowledge transcended the physical realm and into the spiritual . For a long time , they knew more about the universe than they could comprehend how to handle . They were even able to create life . After millennia of loneliness , they finally decided to put their knowledge and technology to a practical use : creating life that would span the entire universe . <newline> <newline> Nura , as the leader of his people , charged himself with the task of overseeing as much construction as was possible . His command ship loomed in the background of the scene which he was watching unfold . From the mouth of the wormhole came hundreds of thousands of cruisers , carrying gargantuan portions of the planet which they were building . He turned his gaze to the unfinished product of dozens of centuries of preparation , and smiled . <newline> <newline> `` Supreme Magistrate ? '' rang a familiar voice softly . How long had his personal aide been standing behind him ? <newline> <newline> Nura thought nothing of it . `` Beautiful , is n't it , Aliarmus ? '' Nura asked , not moving . <newline> <newline> `` With all due respect , your majesty , but this one looks just like the others . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , this one is different . '' <newline> <newline> `` How so , if I may ask ? '' <newline> <newline> Nura turned and smiled softly at his aide . Thulix had served alongside Nura since he first became Supreme Magistrate . He had always been a faithful companion , friend , and confidant . He had many strengths , and utilized each one effectively . His one true weakness , however , was his skepticism . `` Well , Thulix , I plan to do something special with this planet . '' <newline> <newline> `` Something special ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Indeed . '' <newline> <newline> `` What is this special something ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me show you . '' With that , Nura took one last look at his latest project . He then turned to leave , descending a small flight of stairs to a doorway . The doors slid open with a soft hiss , and down a corridor the two friends walked . `` We have had to supply every galaxy with its own stars , planets , asteroid belts . These galaxies run together , you know . However , I feel especially drawn to this planet for some reason , of which I have n't the faintest clue . '' <newline> <newline> Nura and Aliarmus walked through another doorway at the end of the hall and came into a large laboratory . Many others of Nura 's people , all scientists , doctors , and researcers , were busy at different stations inside of the laboratory . When Nura entered , all of them stopped at once and looked up to see who it was . They soon realized it was their leader , and they bowed . `` Up , my friends , and back to work . '' They resumed their tasks , and Nura turned to Aliarmus . <newline> <newline> `` I oversaw construction of this ship , Vel . I know this laboratory well . Why have you brought me here ? '' <newline> <newline> `` To show you why this planet is going to unlike any other planet in the universe . '' <newline> <newline> Nura walked along the a center aisle of sorts , in between desks , computers , and circuitboards of all shapes and sizes . He finally came to the end of the room , and floating in two separate containers , both equal in size , were strange organisms that Thulix had never seen before . <newline> <newline> `` What are these , Supreme Magistrate ? '' <newline> <newline> `` These are of my own creation . Do you like them ? '' <newline> <newline> `` They are interesting , in the very least . '' <newline> <newline> `` I created them in our own image . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yet they look nothing like us . What are you getting at ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Once the planet is finished , I am going to send these two organisms to it to make it their home ; to colonize it ; fertilize it ; reap its rewards and face its consequences . It will be their planet . '' <newline> <newline> `` What are they to be called ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Human . '' <newline> <newline> `` What kind of name is that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's the name I have come up for them . '' <newline> <newline> `` If that 's what you wish . I would have come up with something stronger , but these organisms do n't look too apprehensive . The more I think about it , 'human ' is a nice name for them . Sounds docile , almost . '' <newline> <newline> `` I have beautiful plans for these creatures . I have developed in them strong minds capable of great thought and deduction . They will be able to understand reasoning , science , technology , mathematics , arts , culture , politics . They will no doubt even find their way off of the planet - however , that will not be until the distant future . I believe they will rise to greatness . '' Nura turned to Thulix , his eyes piercing those of his aide . `` That is why I think this planet is special . '' <newline> <newline> `` And what are you to call the planet , your highness ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Planet Earth . ''\n","82":"`` The day Golumpolorpe ( pronounced Go-Lump-O-L-oh-rp ) descended from the heavens was a glorious day , my children ! When I was a young boy , I 'd gather around my grandpa and hear him tell tales of Golumpolorpe 's glory . See , it all happened during my Pap-pap 's lifetime . <newline> <newline> It was a cloudy morning in Time Square , when all of the sudden the clouds parted , and a beam of brilliant light cascaded from the heavens . It was on that light beam that Golumpolorpe came down in all his glory . Oh what a spectacle it was ! People at first thought He was some sort of alien , but when all of the world 's diseases started disappearing people were reassured he was , in fact , God . '' <newline> <newline> The preacher paused to let his story seep into the minds of the audience . His face glowed with pure ecstasy as he continued to recount the tales from his grandfather . Behind him stood a sculpture of Golumpolorpe himself . He had specified that each and every Golumplace must contain His likeness . <newline> And what a glorious statue ! Golumpolorpe 's 17 asymmetrical facial tentacles and beer-gut were really portrayed nicely in that one . His bulging , half-closed right eye was really accurately proportioned with his tiny , closed left eye , and the dead flesh which hung from his elephant-like trunk had perfectly accurate thickness . <newline> <newline> `` My friends and fellow worshipers ! Gaze upon his godly likeness ! Look at his 17 beautiful tentacles . We must honor him ! My own grandfather was THERE . He saw with his own two eyes the 17 tentacles . Counted them himself . We must KILL those filthy infidels who believe he has only 16 tentacles . '' <newline> <newline> The crowd cheered and brandished their 17 pronged pitchforks , their customary 17 tentacled hats jiggled as their wearers jostled with excitement . The collection bowl was passed around , and each patron contributed 17 dollars to the 16-tentacle-r-extermination fund as the preacher continued his sermon . <newline>\n","83":"The group of scientists flipped the switch on their latest completed project , power coursing through the complete model for the first time . With a bang and a flash 3 strange creatures appeared in the room of baffled scientists . They took no notice of the technology hanging from the walls in the whitewashed room . With auick practised movements a device was set up by one of the strange thin pale aliens , and soon beams of light shot from it . Extending to the corners of the earth . From there the light split into great shapes best compared to tv 's . On them the room could be observed everywhere in the world , and the noises made with in it hummed over the planet . `` Congratulations earthlings , you have with the creation of this spaceship joined the interstellar community . We as the emisaries of the united species of galaxy vector gama have come to give you your welcome package . '' there was some rustling as one of the aliens fished a large package out of a very small bead that it should never have fit inside . The cheerful alien voice continued `` inside you will find a decontaminator to avoid the spreading of diseases between races , a copy of the laws that govern contact and space travel and a bean and an extra large bean and cheese burrito from spacio 's for the engineers who built this pioneer space craft to share . '' There was a pause and the smile slowly faded from the creatures face. `` now pay close attention because we ca n't right this down and you will only be showed once . Shortly you will be shown several pictures of beings that exist in the universe widely accepted as gods , a short explanation woll follow if one exists for each . I would like to further warn you that these are beings that should you meet them with the fullness of you power , and the only way to your most penultimate goal is through them , you should turn back and flee . '' an image flickered over the screen briefly , showing an unasumming man dressed in strange clothes . `` This one is originally from your planet , nothing else is known about him , but he is responsible for the dissapearance of several plabets who 's inhabitants upset him . '' another face briefly flitted across the screen . `` You know him as Satan , most places have their own name for him . He is well known for collecting favors that indebt mortals to him , extremely dangerous and malevolent . '' a childs face appeared on the screens of light , lingering longer than the others . `` This child has only been seen once , he was responsible for turning `` the destroyer '' into an old cripple after the prison planet incident . No idea how he does what he does but again , he could probably kill us all so you kknow ... Watch out . '' A bearded face appeared on the screen . Staying there `` this guy is actually a pretty nice guy , we just call him father time . He 's totally nuts but pretty swell , appears to be able to control time . He willingly made contact with many races and enjoys chatting . On the flip side he killed all of us and resurected us when we thought he was a fraud , yup you guys included . Actually the whole universe '' the lights shot back towards the aliens who packed up the equipment efficiently . `` Well that covers it , good luck you guys see you around . '' with no more explanation than that another flash of light appeared and they were gone , replaced by confetti falling around the room , onto the dumbfounded scientist .\n","84":"You think that having super powers is great or good or at the very least ***interesting*** right ? Well , you obviously have n't heard of how I figured out my powers . 'But Kyle , ' you say , 'I 've known you for years and you 're just about the most normal person I know . ' To which I say , 'Yes , that 's how you know I have powers ' . Let me explain , most people in the town have a run in with a super at least once a week , hell , you just told me about your blind date with Dr. Goo yesterday ... By the way , nice to know you had a good time . But that 's besides the point . The point is , I 've never even met one , *ever* .

Anyways , I went out for groceries while that was going on . And you know what ? Nothing happened . Not even a stray wind to blow my hair out of place . I did n't find out what was happening until I passed a TV store and saw it on the news . Anyways , I went home and I got to thinking . And the more I thought , the more I figured it out . I am abnormal , *because repel supers* . I 'm not even joking , I had to go out of my way to find someone with super powers , and asked them to try using them .

It was annoying , but I had to give them credit . They were doing an excellent job . <newline> <newline> I was still at the podium , announcing my plan for Campaign Finance Reform . I had funded most of my campaign prior to announcing my candidacy , so I understand their questions . I had to try and tell them how my plan for oversight was going to help fix Washington . <newline> <newline> `` Folks , folks , lets try to stay focused here . What we 're talking about -- what *I'm* talking about today is a shift in paradigm . Where we no longer allow private corporations to purchase the Presidency . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes but what about your candidacy , Senator ? You raised almost three hundred million dollars in the last 6 months , all without declaring . To some , this might suggest gaming the system . '' A young reporter , Clara Wilde , stared at me expectantly . She was a fantastic reporter , which made her problematic on the trail . <newline> <newline> I smiled , and explained . `` Look , as you all know , I 'm a straight shooter . Yes , I raised quite a bit of money . However , I did n't break any laws , and you can see the donor list on my website . What I 'm trying to point out is that *after* declaring a candidacy , money raised must come from the people , rather than corporations , as that will -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait '' she said , cutting me off . `` How does that help ? Would n't that just push the announcements back by several months , as candidates fundraised privately ? Effectively shortening the campaign time and not allowing the American people to make an informed decision at the polls ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' I smiled again , this bitch was getting on my last nerve . `` No , of course not , part of the reform would restrict private fundraising to a specific window -- '' <newline> <newline> `` So as long as you have powerful friends , you 'll do fine . '' She countered . `` But if you 're starting grass roots , you 're kind of on your own . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' I started again . She cut me off . <newline> <newline> `` Senator , you 're the only one among your running mates who was able to raise the kind of money you did , and part of that might be do to your connections in the Private Sector . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' I said . `` I do n't think that 's -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Senator , be honest now '' She said , hand on her hip . `` You 're telling us that your connections in Tech and Aerospace have not given you a leg up on your running mates ? When just last week you raised forty million from FreeLabs Aeronautics , with who 's CEO you regularly meet with and -- '' <newline> <newline> I snapped . <newline> <newline> `` ENOUGH ! '' I said . `` Who gives a shit ? Who gives a shit who I know ? Yes , I have friends in places that will help me along the road to the White House , and yes , they donated generously to my campaign . It does n't matter though , because I 'm talking about *after* declaring candidacy . I could raise a billion dollars privately and as long as I do n't take a cent of it after announcing , I will not have broken any laws , and it would in no way prevent anyone else from doing the same . '' <newline> <newline> The crowd was quiet , but I was n't done . I wanted her eviscerated . <newline> <newline> `` Furthermore , who gives a shit if no one else can raise the funds ? Quite honestly , if you ca n't find people to finance your campaign then you do n't deserve the White House ! You talk about `` grass roots '' like its some fucking buzzword that means something to the American people . Like they 'll open their own wallets and donate to your candidacy . Let me tell you something , you no-name Connecticut bitch , the American people do n't care about campaign finance . They care about McDonalds and they care about Coke and what the hottest stars are wearing ! Depending on the vote of the American people to get elected is a death wish , and if the other candidates ca n't see that , then they deserve to lose. `` <newline> <newline> You could have heard a pin drop . And we were outside , in the grass . Clara was taking furious notes ; they all were . Dave , my campaign manager , was frantically waving for me to walk off stage . I smiled , and tried to regain composure . <newline> <newline> `` Ha , haha . Sorry folks , I 'm just passionate about Campaign Finance Reform . What I meant ... what I was attempting to say to Ms. Wilde is that the American People need representatives , and we ca n't rely on them to vote ... we ca n't rely on them to just pay for our Campaign needs . We need to work with our friends in the Private Sector to bolster our democracy . Small business ... '' <newline> <newline> I trailed off . No one was listening now anyway . Reporters were on their cell phones , cameras were still rolling . I smiled and glanced at Dave , who was waving both arms above his head , the clipboard in his hand stripping the tree branch above him of its leaves . He was waving at the live band , and as soon as they saw him , they started playing . <newline> <newline> I could n't just leave it like that . I smiled and gave two thumbs up . `` All the way to 2016 ! '' I said . What the fuck did that even mean ? <newline> <newline> I dropped my hands , smiled again , and walked off stage .\n","86":"Freddy vs . The Fuzz <newline> <newline> At 12:30am Friday morning , local police dispatch received a panicked phone call from a security guard at Freddy Fazzbear \u2019 s Pizzeria . The guard was stammering , obviously fearing for his life , claiming that the animatronic characters that are the hallmark attractions of the establishment were out to kill him , that the company had deliberately restricted his power so that he would die , and how he had no means to defend himself . <newline> Knowing that the establishment was frugal with power almost to a fault , and that said power was restricted by an automatic breaker device , it was decided to send in a SWAT team to help resolve the situation . While the SWAT team was en route , members of the electrical company disabled the automatic breaker , giving the poor soul unlimited power . After informing dispatch that the lights were on and the doors to the security office safely sealed , the call was terminated . <newline> At 1:03am , the SWAT van arrived on the scene . The squad of six , consisting of officers West , Fastlove , Carter , O \u2019 Hare , McKinley & Trane , was ordered to perform a hard target sweep . They were all equipped with standard electrical disarming equipment , with the plan being to disable the animatronics through physical force ( and shotguns ) , then dismantle them to permanently remove the threat . <newline> At 1:05am , the SWAT team performed a door breach leading into the kitchen , charging in with full riot gear in tow . They were immediately rushed by one of the animatronics ( later ID \u2019 d as FOXY ) . O \u2019 Hare was pinned down and forced to fight off the rampaging mechanical fox , but Trane charged it with a riot shield , managing to knock it over . It became clear that keeping stable footing was not part of the programming that ran the animatronics , as the fox tried hopelessly to stand up again . O \u2019 Hare unloaded a 12-gauge shotgun at point blank , knocking the head off and making the animatronic fall silent . O \u2019 Hare and Trane began a thorough dismantling of the fox , as the rest of the team moved into the main dining area . <newline> At 1:06 , the team had locked down the main dining area , and the remains of Foxy were being collected in a nearby trash can . However , the disturbing revelation was that , although the fox that normally occupied the Pirate Cove area was going to be recycled , the other three characters ( ID \u2019 d as FREDDY , CHICA and BONNIE ) were out of their normal places . It was determined that the restrooms and backstage area would be swept , and afterwards the west and east halls would be cleared in addition to the supply closet . Then , they would extract the security guard , shut down all systems and call in the cops to shut the place down for good . <newline> At 1:07 , West , McKinley and Fastlove were in the middle of checking both restrooms , when they heard clanking footsteps from the connecting hallway . The officers barely had time to ready their weapons when a giant purple rabbit assaulted them , metal teeth chomping fiercely . Fastlove lost a chunk of his left arm to this thing , but West & McKinley quickly pinned and disabled \u201c Bonnie \u201d . Fastlove was given battlefield Triage by McKinley , and was rushed back to the main dining area . <newline> At 1:08 , the SWAT team decided to move up to lethal force . The raid on the backstage area was therefore preceded by a high explosive grenade , but what was found inside was even more gruesome : a bear suit dripping with blood and bits of brain , with a pair of human eyes dangling out the front . The five active members of the team decided to step up the pace . <newline> At 1:10 , the last two animatronic characters entered the dining area as the SWAT team was preparing to storm the halls . Needless to say , the hail of bullets that followed tore the costumes off the frames , but the frame kept moving forward towards the officers . The duck went down first , as one of its legs was taken off by shotgun fire . The bear managed to get within melee distance of Carter , but Carter knocked it over and crushed it with a nightstick . Both frames twitched after the takedown , but the team dismantled them with thermite charges ( later justified by the phrase \u201c just to be safe \u201d ) . <newline> At 1:12 , the team stormed the hallways , with the west team throwing grenades into supply closet . After making contact with the security guard , the SWAT officers requested the doors to be opened . The officer complied , and the team left the pizzeria with a witness in tow . The evidence that would be compiled within the next four hours would be enough to shut down the establishment permanently and get the management imprisoned for a minimum of five years .\n","87":"Sarah was a nice woman . Troubled , but interesting . Very attractive . She was obsessed with me through out highschool . `` If you ever leave '' and stuff like that . <newline> <newline> She had a terrible past , and I knew it . I saw her father . The terrifying thing was that his abuse of her , it was n't the worst thing he had done . <newline> <newline> I had seen what he did to those people when he was angry . I knew all about his first wife and her `` mysterious disappearance '' . The weakness of my gift is that you can only see the darkest in people . Not everything they 've done . I 'm sure he had done other stuff as bad as that , but I guess the `` gift '' is based on my morals and ethics . If I suddenly thought murder was OK , and shoplifting was the worst crime man could commit , I might not be able to keep my job . I 'm a detective . I 've worked at my job for 4 years . I think ? I do n't know . Maybe its six . It all blurs together . <newline> <newline> People think I 'm an amazing detective . It makes me feel guilty almost . These other people put their soul into their work . Constantly trying to get better . And they will *never* be as good as me . <newline> <newline> I 'm wandering . I apologize , but I need to get this out . <newline> <newline> Sarah is a mentally weak individual . She is easily manipulated , its the biggest scar of her abuse . This is how I justify planting evidence on her father . He may not have really robbed that store . But it fits , you know ? <newline> Desperate person . Needs money . Had a firearm with a caliber that matched the gun used to kill the cashier . That was n't me , that was just purely dumb luck . <newline> <newline> I knew until he was out of Sarahs mind we could n't live happily . Neither could Sarahs mother , Liz . I knew Lizs darkest secret before , it was the first time I saw one `` change '' . See , my gift does n't work like a movie . You do n't see this little text over someones head . What they did , how long ago , why they did it . It simply shows right before the event through the persons eyes . This is what makes my job hard . Knowing Joe Blow killed somebody ? Check . Knowing where they hid the body ? Why they did it ? Who the person was ? Nope . <newline> <newline> Its what made looking into my father in laws eyes so much worse . I could see that poor girl who found out about what was in his past , I do n't know what it was , but nothing would shock me . I see her slap him . I see him loading his gun . I see her head just snap . I could n't live like that . <newline> <newline> When my wifes father was on trial , Liz testified against him . That he confessed . This was her darkest secret , and I 'll admit , re-living that moment of shock on that piece of shits face as his wife testified against him every time I see Liz ? Its a great feeling . <newline> <newline> But the thing is , thoughts do n't count . They may be their darkest secret , but they 're off limits . I just see grey . Jane Doe is banging the bar tender while her husbands at home ? I see it all too well . If she is thinking about it , and its the worst things she plans to do , its just not there . Thats what caught me off guard at the trial . Liz refused to testify until that day . <newline> <newline> This is what has happened to my Sarah . I ca n't see what she is doing . Its grey . I think she is thinking about an affair . And I think I know who with too . This manipulative little prick at my work . He hates me , and I hate him too . He might be the next best detective in terms of arrests and convictions , because he does n't mind putting an innocent man behind bars . Or planting evidence . I know , I 'm a hypocrite . <newline> <newline> Like I said , Sarah is a very weak person who can be manipulated easily . The main reason I married her is because I knew if I did n't she would end up dead . <newline> <newline> This guy , we 'll call him `` Sam '' , has it out for me . He is the typical has to be number one at everything guy . But he ca n't be . Because I 'm better than him . <newline> <newline> I know Sarah likes him . He is the spitting image of her father . And I know this dick would do anything to get me out of the way . I 'm happy where I 'm at career wise . Sam is n't . He has bigger , more political aspirations . And I think he knows about my gift . He has found ways to test me . He knows I can sink his campaign with what I 've got on him . That `` Laara Hotel Rape of 1991 '' ? Him and his buddies know more about that then they let on . But again , its not my place to punish everybody , and I ca n't get physical proof anyway . But he does n't know that . <newline> <newline> Sarah has been in this `` grey '' area for 18 hours . I know I have to confront it . I intend to do so tonight . Maybe she will just level with me , and if I can get her to actually do something , maybe I can put this all together . <newline> <newline> <newline> We talk . It goes terribly . She shuts me out . She screams . I sleep on the couch . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> A flash goes by outside my house . Its Sams car . The lights stop . The door to my house opens . I hear someone enter . I hear someone coming down the steps . I hear a gun cock . I hear wrestling . I hear my wife scream . I 'm frozen . It goes off . I feel a terrible pain in my chest . <newline> <newline> <newline> I awaken some hours later . Surrounded by doctors . I see everything they 've done and its terrible . I see the nurse forgetting to give a child the correct medicine , not the one he is allergic to . I see him screaming . And I see her crying . I see the doctor screwing up the heart operation surgery because he was out drinking the night before , or so I put together myself , I can see through the fog in my eyes that he is hungover . <newline> <newline> But this . This is n't real . These are just bits and pieces of the last 24 hours . <newline> <newline> Sam walks in . He is in tears . I fully expect to see myself or my wife getting shot . In the first person . I prepare mentally for the worst . I see what he thinks is his worst action . I see him fucking my wife . I hear him apologize to me , but i 'm in no condition to respond . <newline> <newline> `` My fault . All my fault . She did this because of what I did '' <newline> <newline> What ? <newline> <newline> What shes done . <newline> <newline> Security escorts Sam out . He screams he is innocent . That he tried to stop it . Stop what ? <newline> <newline> Sarah walks in . It comes together . I see Sam run through the front door . I see my wife loading the gun . I see Sam tackle her . I see her still managing to do it . I hear Sams pleading for her not to do it at gunpoint . I feel the pain in my chest all over again . <newline> <newline> And then grey . I see the doctor talk to Sarah in the corner . I see him begin to tear up . I see her `` cry '' and nod . I hear the nurses come in . This is it . <newline> <newline> The button is pressed . My breathing slows . My pulse slows ever so slightly . Second by second . I accept my fate . <newline> <newline> She leans in to kiss me . And I relive the whole thing again . No gray this time . The clarity makes it a little easier to accept . <newline> <newline> I see black . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> WRITERS NOTE : I wrote this in a half hour at 4:30 AM .

'' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son nodded , he had doffed the battered battle armor , but his over-repaired under-armor and battle clothes were his only coverings . Times were tough for the Harkorian Empire , and with their war against Calbolnians who were denigrated with the comparison to kanabs , a hard-shelled crustacean that were bottom feeders in the oceans . <newline> The insult though was that these Kanabs had been disabusing the Harkorian 's for near two centuries now of their territories and the might of Harkorian 's military prowess . The Empire was crumbling , and solar systems had began to `` surrender '' to the Calbolnians . <newline> <newline> Kalo'son laid his satchel on the marred table that also served as a secretarial and security desk . Apparently a few cowards in Parliament had taken it upon themselves to end the war by assassinating the High Elder . <newline> <newline> But , like all wars , things changed . Kalo'son waited at the elevator that would take him down to the chambers of council . His thoughts drifted to when the war first started . <newline> <newline> Yes , we kind of did start this one . The elevator door slid open , and he stepped in with the Attache . And we did kind of allowed our conceit to push the Calbolnians into a corner ... seriously , we blatantly grabbed three systems they had founded , and were developing . Korafora , or in the Calbolnian 's harsh language , `` Bhaklak '' is ... um , was a beautiful ocean and island world . He would never go back there . Ever . <newline> <newline> He bowed his head as the memory of what he witnessed blasted back to his mind . It 's war , he told himself , and shit like this happens in war so do n't think about it . Just do n't think about it . For the love of the gods , just do n't think about it . <newline> <newline> Letting out a strong exhale which drew the attention of the Attache , Kalo'son nodded with a weak smile , and returned his attention to the door . <newline> <newline> The elevator stopped , and Attache took the lead and that is when he noticed that the Attache was packing one of the Terran 's Powered .50x75 pistols . He 'd seen what those things did to the Calbolnians , what it did to their armor , and to whatever was left after it penetrated . Swallowing hard , he flexed his shoulders , and followed . The memories were inching back again . <newline> <newline> The Attache opened a finely chiseled wood door of a pastoral woodland with Harkorian 's lounging around trees , and lakes . For some reason he stopped to take in that scene . It looked like a dream , one of which a person of faith would hope to see again even though they know they never would . Kalo'son knew inside there would never be a peace like that for him . He had seen to much . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , High General , I 'm so glad to see you ! '' The High Elder arose from his seat , as did the council members whom all seemed to be in much higher spirits than they did a few years ago . The High Elder came to him , and clapped him on his shoulder , enraging a sore spot from the last battle . <newline> <newline> `` High Elder . '' Kalo'son bowed as he greeted his brother , and friend . `` And of course , Council . '' Again he bowed . <newline> <newline> `` So , '' began G'falon , '' We have won the war ! This is great news for us ! '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son looked at his brother , then at the council , `` I think you 've over estimated our contribution to their victory , brother . '' Kalo'son ignored his brother 's frown , and moved to the wet bar where he helped himself to a Black Water Kep , straight , no ice . Tipping the crystal glass , the soft tink of the rim hitting his canines was the only other sound in the room . Even the drink ca n't wash away these damnable memories . <newline> <newline> `` Not at all , '' G'falon looked at the frowning faces of the council as he approached his brother . `` you should have been in on the council conference when that prima-donna King B'tikak beg me , he begged me to accept his surrender right then and there ... ah , brother , it is a good day ! '' <newline> <newline> `` The Terrans , brother ... '' But G'falon waved that off . <newline> <newline> `` We 'll have them back on their back water system in no time . '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son barked a sharp , disdainful laugh . `` you have no idea what we 've unleashed , do you ? '' <newline> <newline> Setting the glass down on the counter , Kalo'son stepped around his brother to look at the council . That Terran commander was right , we do look like their dogs ... what did he call those things , their pets , yes , pets . <newline> <newline> `` You sent me to the Terran 's to help us unfuck our fuck-up . '' His arm swinging wide now , his memories flooding back in . `` You told me to give them Faster than Light Travel so they could do our bidding , and fight the Calbolnians . A war we started . I want that to sink in . We started this war , not the Kanab 's , us , we here in this room . We pushed for war , and the fucking Kanab 's took us up on our offer , and beat us ... like 'dogs . ' '' Frowns from the council members and his brother told him that they were not familiar with that particular Terran word . <newline> <newline> `` But we won . '' His brother said with determination , with several of the Council members barking their agreement . <newline> <newline> Kalo'son shook his head , these dolts just do n't get it . `` No , no 'we ' did n't win a damn thing , the Terrans won . '' His eyes lost their focus as he watched the Terrans infantry , millions of them after their victory on Korafora , starving from the lack of supplies began eating those poor Kanabs dead and soon to be dead . What was that word they kept saying , `` batter ? '' No , `` butter ? '' Yes , butter , all they talked about was how much better the kanabs would be with butter . He could hear the shells being cracked open , the sounds of sucking and slurping as their innards were being devoured . By the gods , what have we done ? <newline> <newline> `` But we are Harkorians , this is our Empire ! '' The Council started nodding vigorously as G'falon slammed his palm on the counter , and then pointing at Kalo'son , he snarled , `` And you will thank the Terran 's for their service to our Empire , have them surrender any ships with our FTL engines , and then put them all back into their system . And if they have a problem with that , then we 'll put them down like we did the Pallagins . '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son levelly looked at his brother and then at the council , the rage he should be feeling did not explode as he thought it would , `` As you wish , Brother . I will deliver your message . '' He could n't tell his brother what he had seen at Korafora because then he would have to tell him what he saw at Falkomon , a decimated Harkorian city . There , the Terrans were also eating the dead , and dying but this time it was the Harkorians who filled their bellies , and in some cases , their own kind . It was a never-ending nightmare that would only find peace when he went was sent to his long sleep . <newline> <newline> He would deliver the message , turning to the Attache as they walked out of the chambers , `` You might want to leave the Citadel ... and soon . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why ? '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son thought for a moment , `` because I 'm going to go kick a giant , and if we 're lucky he 'll squash us like a bug . '' <newline> <newline> `` and if we 're unlucky ? '' <newline> <newline> Kalo'son stepped into the elevator and pressed the up button to the ground level , as the door was closing he replied , `` he 'll slap us down , and eat us alive . ''\n","91":"I was shocked . I 've always had a sort of irrational fear of flying , being thousands of meters in the air and not knowing whether or not my plane would have the minuscule chance of becoming just another crash statistic . My eyes met with the stranger 's , his were a sky blue and his hair black like oil and slicked back . He wore a rather swanky business suit . His tie was blood red along with his matching handkerchief , protruding out his front jacket pocket . His legs were calmly crossed and he leaned in ever so slightly . <newline> `` I said the plane will crash '' he whispered . <newline> I could see the neatness of his pencil mustache , probably just recently trimmed . His breath had the distinct odor of peppermint and vodka . <newline> `` What ? '' I managed to whimper , clearly shaken by what the man had said . <newline> He laughed loudly and then louder and louder . Soon his malicious laughed seem to echo throughout the entire plane . <newline> `` Your drunk '' I said disgustingly as I got up to use the restroom . I was still visibly shaken and sweating even after I reached the toilets . I stopped an attendant as I waited for the bathroom to become vacant and asked her if I could change seats . <newline> `` My neighbor is very rude and unpleasant '' I explained politely. `` Plus I 'm sure he is drunk , and you should have heard what he told me ... '' <newline> The attendant asked where was I sitting . As I turned to point the plane suddenly began to shake violently . I was thrown down and quickly crawled back to my seat . I climbed my chair and turned to look up at the man . He was gone . Where he was sitting was a copy of the New York Times . The headline read `` Plane Crashes Outside Newark .

Many consider me a true psychic , other consider me a scam . I am what I am . <newline> <newline> I wake up slightly shivering . I have been doing this job for many years , but the fear of these dreams are still able to haunt me . I grabbed my phone and called him . <newline> <newline> `` Rodriguez .

Everyone in the room had the same thoughts . Noone had the answers . <newline> <newline> Suddenly , a crackling noise signaled that the speaker system was turned on : `` Uhm ... s-so I think you should see this , it is broadcasting on all channels , nationwide ...

Instead , a black screen , on which , in red lettering , the following words appeared : `` To the people of the United States of America '' A few seconds passed , noone even dared to blink .

I woke up the day after , acting like nothing was wrong . I skipped down the stairs , just hopping it was all a nightmare , and the moment I opened that kitchen door I 'd see her again . I 'd see her smile , I 'd see her laugh of how I was always the late bugger . The door swung open , there was no smile , there was no laugh .

I left it there , without a care in the world as I trudged my way up the stairs . <newline> <newline> The phone rang as I was halfway up , and I paused . Either phone was far away `` Ashley , can you get the phone ? '' I yelled . I realized my mistake a few moments afterwards and the answering machine picked up . It was her mother , checking up on me to make sure I was alright . No , I was n't alright . I was ready to both cry in tears , and fight everyone in a mile radius of me . I could n't though , I could n't find the strength to keep going . <newline> <newline> I jumped into bed , and closed my eyes . Even my dreams were of her . I could smell her scent , see her motions . Everything seemed so real , but when I awoke , I cried . My mind entered a dark zone , one I never escaped from .

I plugged the toaster into the wall outlet , and lifted it above the waters that I stayed . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll be home soon , '' I said as tears rushed down my ears `` It 's been too long .

They were big beasts of hoverbikes , vaguely resembling a bar of soap floating a few feet above the ground turned on it \u2019 s long , narrow side , slightly shaved near the top to create a seat , steer , and dashboard . They were the hardest to mount , hardest to dismount , hardest to fly , and hardest to use , but the cheapest on the market . He was a low karma user , floating at around Level 34 , which was just around the point where people stopped looking at you like livestock laying in the middle of the open highway . <newline> <newline> Normally the brick he called a hoverbike would be too high tech for an area like this , but thankfully , the moderators around these parts were merciful . It was the only thing powerful and durable enough to get through such a coarse part of the city . The admins of New Reddit must have been intoxicated on their drug of choice when porting the site over to the wide expanses of Virtual Reality . When given infinite space and infinite potential for creating a site , they decided to create a grimy vaguely cyberpunk dystopia that was far too crowded for comfort . Overtime the various subreddit creators started to circumvent this by buying lots , floating landmasses connected to the rest of the city though an elaborate system of sub ( reddit ) ways , bridges , floating streets , and Warp Points . <newline> <newline> By now , Wander can see the first few skyscrapers . They reach far too high up to possibly fathom never mind see , holding within them massive lots containing even more subreddits , subreddit networks , and residences . From what a stranger could piece together from the surrounding environment the lot he was currently in was the remains of a large subreddit network that had fallen through long ago . Perhaps it was once great , forgotten by the unforgiving nature of time . Perhaps , more likely , it was a large lot bought for a planned subreddit network that had fallen through , a sort of Babeline monument to their failures . Whatever it was , someone paid some good Bitcoin for it . It looks old , but what \u201c old \u201d is when time itself is malleable in virtual reality ( The entire city travels at a minimum rate of 60 irl minutes to a single second , though there are locations where the rate is much , much higher ) is rather subject to pseudo-intellectual debate . <newline> <newline> The edge is close now . It once took up the entire horizon , but now it \u2019 s been charging at the bike like a crazed bull . The man who was once a boy eases out .

The bike stops a stone \u2019 s throw from the edge.He looks upwards . <newline> <newline> The city is nice this time of year . Ships fly far , far above his head . Mega-Boards , signs miles wide and tall , project the top articles of the day . Times are dangerous now . Hostilities between Reddit and Tumblr are the tensest in decades ; war seems inevitable at this point . Love and sex and memes and the faint smell of circlejerk carry on the winds here . But in these strange days twilight seems to creep through the most unexpected places . <newline> <newline> The Wanderer dismounts his bike , and looks towards the east as if direction mattered here . His long robes brush up some dirt . The edge goes along for miles in either direction . He looks out over the edge . Another skyscraper runs parallel with it . Below him , a bridge crosses out from somewhere underground out directly into the building . He silently notes this , and climbing back onto the brick resigns himself back to another day of travel .

Arrows stopped at arm 's length , before falling to the ground in front of me . <newline> <newline> The war drums filled my ears and flooded my body . All the earth followed the rhythm . The beat pushed us onwards . Each resounding boom was a command . *Charge . Fight . Win . * Arrows flew back and forth overhead . It did n't matter . No one would die in this battle until one side or the other lost the rhythm . That was how wars were fought , and that was how wars were won . Destroy the beat , you destroyed the entire army . <newline> <newline> I could hear the hideous sounds of the sawtooth instruments of our enemy . It was impure and wretched . Our empire had adopted the drums of war . We did not require melody . Every man knew the Rhythm , and that was our strength . <newline> <newline> I closed my eyes and exhaled slowly . I absorbed the Rhythm , and it became me . My heart beat to the Rhythm . I fought to the Rhythm . Every step , every blow , every parry , was directed to the Rhythm . <newline> <newline> The ground shook . To one side of us it began to crack and roar . The earth spewed out fire upon the enemy , and their screams and wails only joined our Rhythm . Such was the power of the drum . <newline> <newline> My squadron and I charged forwards . Perfect unison . I raised my shield to block the blow of an enemy solider . Even if I had n't , he could n't kill me . I was completely invincible . I should have stumbled to the ground long ago in exhaustion . This battle had gone on far too long . I swung my sword low , to his knees , and he leapt back . I saw my chance . I surged forwards , slamming my shield against his chest . He grunted , eyes widening.He collapsed beneath me . His heart stopped . He had lost his rhythm . <newline> <newline> I focused on the Rhythm , trying to block out the rhythms of the enemy . They faded down to almost nothing , and I once more began my assault . I could hear our Rhythm speeding up . A dangerous tactic , to be sure . It could easily cause your entire army to lose the protection of the beat , but it , when used properly , could easily catch the other side off guard , causing them to fall , revoked of their powers . <newline> <newline> It worked . I could see hundreds of them collapse from exhaustion , trampled beneath the tidal forces of both armies . <newline> <newline> I caused many men to lose their rhythm that day .

But every time I faithfully followed where it led me . <newline> <newline> Then , there was nothing . Where I expected the boom of the drums , there was only silence . We fought as one , and now we fell as one . Our heart stopped . <newline> <newline> They had stopped our Rhythm . <newline> <newline> I could feel the darkness closing in . <newline> <newline> Weakly , I gripped my sword . <newline> <newline> With all my strength , I pounded it against my shield <newline> <newline> *Bang . * <newline> <newline> I closed my eyes , expecting to die . But then , I heard another clang of sword against shield . <newline> <newline> Then another . <newline> <newline> And another . <newline> <newline> The Rhythm had died <newline> <newline> But now we made a new song . <newline> <newline> And we rose again . <newline> <newline> As one . <newline> <newline> _______________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> I know I 'm kinda late to the party , but this was what came to mind when I read this prompt .

Sadly it was revealed not to be the work of a divinely inspired artist working on the human body , but merely a standard practice of the Dixie Mafia , who were inexplicably trying to muscle in .

There was no outrage or panic on the Martian colonies . They did n't much care anyways , seeing as how they felt more isolated from Earth , as compared to those living on the Moon . The gravity changed them , and the Martians felt that left them a different strain of the same species . <newline> <newline> The moon could only watch in silent terror . The monorails flooded Central station , coming from all of the distant corners of the colony , which was spread about much like a spider 's web , with Central station being the largest , brightest . Everyone flocking to see the spectacle . <newline> <newline> I was indifferent at first , having thought the same thing as many others - must be some kind of solar storm . We were shielded from the sun at the start , so it was a logical conclusion . But when we were n't , and our systems did n't fail , I became concerned . So I took a spot along a window facing the planet , one of the many sipping my coffee and watching , hoping , and waiting for something reassuring to happen . <newline> <newline> The lights were dimming , slowly fading away . One continent at a time . America was the first to darken . I felt a bit sick . I still had family in the south . <newline> <newline> I left the window after that . I mulled around my quarters for hours , it seemed , looking up to see mere minutes had passed . I called anyone who would pick up on the comm . Most were as speechless and worried as I was , and the calls were short . <newline> <newline> Then came the calls from Mars . About communications relays not working anymore . Nobody could contact Houston . Nobody could contact Tokyo . Moscow had sent the last transmissions , mostly garbled . <newline> <newline> With nothing better to do , I elbowed my way into the crowded common room nearest my quarters . I grabbed a coffee off a tray a server was holding , passing out to the gawkers with the same notion as me . I stood in front of the window , praying to God above that I 'd see something to lift our spirits . <newline> <newline> Instead , the last lights blinked out in Australia . The silence was unbearable . I saw tears in the eyes of one girl , who I knew to work in the hydroponics bay , and had a clear Australian accent . <newline> <newline> The intercomm buzzed on . Everyone turned to the feed , where the base commander was sitting behind his desk as usual on the morning announcements . `` The Yellowstone supervolcano has erupted . We can not go home . ''\n","102":"Light . Dark . Colors . Shades . <newline> <newline> Everything swarms and swallows my body as my eyes flicker open . The darkness pushing on the edges of light seeming to be in an ever constant battle more futile by the growing minute . As my surroundings zero in and become clear all of a sudden one thing becomes clear . Everything seems so new to me as if I was taking my first breath . I began trying to access memories and there was nothing . No family , friends , schools or jobs everything seemed so vacant . A slight panic began to fill my chest as I was grasping for something tangible . Where did it all begin ? Why ca n't I remember anything ? I thought to myself , and decided the next step would be to figure out where I am . An alley way laying in , based on the smell , week old garbage and a couple feet to my right is a strange woman wearing a yellow summer dress that exposes her smooth arms with a modest cut just above the knees . Her skin is a beautiful sun kissed olive the imperfections of her tan lines shine through on her right shoulder due to a slight fold of the strap . She does n't use makeup which accented her natural beauty all the more . The brown thin belt gently hugging her hips and white headband snugly holding her long curly brunette hair back give her an even more calm sentiment then I first noticed . Her presence eased the panic so I reached out . <newline> <newline> `` Um , excuse me , '' I started , `` Where am I ? '' <newline> <newline> She stood their statuesque . Not a sound or a movement not even the raising and lowering of her chest . I shut my eyes and reopen them trying to gather myself , upon opening them the familiar battle of light versus dark floods back and the clarity returns . Only this time the peaceful woman is gone . I conduct a quick scan of my surroundings . It is night time and the alley is suddenly very empty except for myself and this odd pile of trash bags . The building we are lying against has no doors in sight and the fence in front of me has no openings . The light pole dead center of the alley evenly lit everything . I kept wondering where this trash came from . When from above I am smacked by a recently filled bag of trash I felt the warmth of certain parts and the cool liquid of others pressing against me as it rolled to my left . I look up to see a guy pulling out one of his headphones , `` I 'm sorry man I did n't see you there . You really should n't lay in a pile of trash though '' he added . Just then I see the girl just behind his shoulder standing there as still as before . I ignored the man and scurried to my feet . I backed towards the fence to get a better view of the two . His back was towards me now with both headphones in he was walking away . `` Hey , how did you get up there ? '' Again nothing . Again gone . <newline> <newline> I turned right headed towards the busiest of the two directions . I had noticed heavy foot traffic and cars passing this way and I was hoping somebody could help me . I emerged from the alley to see the light really fighting against the dark even pushing it back . The youth filled the streets with joy , bright neon lights plagued the signs on this street . Inns , pubs , piano bars , restaurants all bustling with the interactions of joyful spirits . Just then an epiphany . I reached into my trouser pocket and found a wallet . I found an ID . `` Gerald Arthur , '' Great sadness filled me holding my ID , `` Gerald Arthur FREEZE ! '' I turned and saw a woman in an all blue uniform with a shield above her heart yelling to me . In the reflection of the light on her glasses I saw a figure behind me waving . It was the girl and she took off running . Almost out of instinct I follow . The three way chase is zigzagging in out of the youth that filled the street . There hurried conversations sent an alarming feeling down my spine . They must all be talking about me . BUT WHY ? Just then the girl turns right down a street out of my sight . I turn right on the same street still hearing the officer yelling behind me . Again gone . `` DAMMIT ! '' I loosed in anger . The panic is growing again . She is going to be here any minute . I keep on moving down the street . I make a left onto a less eventful street one that the darkness seemed to be winning against the light . I hid in the shadows and kept moving . I heard behind me people telling the officer where I had went . And thought to myself they should mind their own business . She sees the shine of my orange outfit in the dark and again yells , `` FREEZE ! '' Naturally I did n't I kept moving . Only this time I see her . Her standing there waving for me to move faster . She heads right and again I make a right off this street and downhill my pace became swifter as physics took over and I embraced it . She 's gone again but I feel that I am heading the right direction . The busy nightlife dying in the background only to be replaced by my heavy breath and the eerie stillness of the residential district I was entering . This nagging feeling of familiarity began to weigh me down and my pace slowed it could have been the evening out of the pavement to a flat surface or the fact that I am getting tired but I knew better . There she was and she knew better . <newline> <newline> The officer was still in pursuit but the distance between us had grown and I was relieved by that . I make a right , a left then another right . She was persistent I will give her that . But I was in an instinctual mode knowing every nook and cranny of this neighborhood . Just as I was feeling like I was getting close to where I was leading she appeared again the girl waving me on and pointing at something with joy . Just then I noticed a house to my right that slowed me in my tracks . It was a large two story with a wraparound porch and one rocking chair on either side of the front entrance everything was so symmetrical the light and darkness displaying it prominently in the night even the yellow caution tape that sealed it off from illegal entrance . My nagging feeling turned into dread . Why is this important . I felt my body come to a complete stop . I approached the house . It had a date of three weeks prior labeled on it . Images began to fill my head of a woman and child screaming . A loud deafening noise rang in my mind . The officer was nearing again yelling for me , `` STOP Gerald just STOP , '' but her voice elicited a flight response from me . My feet began to pound the pavement as the foot race intensified . Another twenty minutes passed of running with no sign of the girl nothing at all but familiar surroundings came and went around me . Why was this officer so intense ? She should have given up by now I thought to myself . Not an ounce of quit in her . I made a right again . The girl appeared once more in the cemetery standing there this time in-between two tombstones in the distance . They were two newer looking tombstones this was easy to pick up on because they were n't as weather worn as the others . Again my body came to a stop . My eyes settled upon the names . And tears spilled from my eyes . I looked up at the girl and noticed a smaller girl holding onto her yellow dress peering around from behind her . She was terrified of me they both were but they both still looked at me with such loving eyes . And I knew why . I know it all . <newline> <newline> Michelle Arthur . Here lies a loving mother taken from us too soon . <newline> <newline> Annabelle Arthur . Here lies a daughter and a light extinguished before her time . <newline> <newline> The officer came up on me gun drawn , `` Do n't move Gerald . You son of a bitch do n't move . '' I continued sobbing and did n't acknowledge her . `` Say something Gerald . Say something . '' My silence continued I just could n't bring myself to turn and face her because I knew who she was . `` I do n't know how you escaped but I am not letting you get away . '' She said then the tears she was holding back began to fill her eyes . `` I loved you . You were my son . How could you have done this to my family . My daughter and granddaughter were taken to soon . Because of you . You son of a bitch . I trusted you and you did this with that trust . Well I hope you are happy with yourself . I hope you are proud . This will be your legacy . A murder of the things he loves . A destroyer of things that are beautiful and true . I hate you . And I hope all manners of evil plague you from here on out you bastard . '' <newline> <newline> `` I know this wo n't help any but I was n't myself that night . I had no recollection of it until this night . I am so sorry . So completely and utterly sorry for everything I 've done to our family . If only there were something I could do to make this right . '' I wailed to her . <newline> <newline> `` There is something . '' She whispered . <newline> <newline> `` Anything . '' I pleaded . <newline> <newline> `` YOU CAN DIE ! '' She exclaimed . <newline> <newline> That familiar loud deafening noise rang throughout the cemetery . As I grabbed for my heart . <newline> <newline> She ran over and held me in her arms crying more hysterically than before . `` I 'm so sorry . I thought this would help me but it did n't . Please do n't die she bartered . '' <newline> <newline> With my final breath and action I delivered an , `` I love you . '' Trying to fake a smile for her . <newline> <newline> The darkness engulfed all the light that was left . In the cemetery , in my eyes , in her soul and in the world . It seems that no matter how hard the light tries to brighten its surroundings it always finds the darkness is there first waiting for it . <newline>\n","103":"Do n't bother reading this , it 's got a major logical flaw that I did n't realize until the end .

His submission earned him a pardon , and the seat of Sunday on the council . <newline> <newline> Councilman Tuesday was brooding over the proposal . <newline> <newline> `` But it is n't really her 'death , ' per se , that 's funny , right ? '' <newline> <newline> Councilman Friday shook his head . <newline> <newline> `` No . The law dictates that the execution be broadcast to the world for entertainment .

They were a hardy and adaptable race that had been waging war on themselves for millennia . They entertained themselves with battle so it was a perfect fit . <newline> <newline> The other races were not informed by the Eldar Council of this decision . The tenuous peace pacts had to be preserved but they felt this security force would handle the unrest well . <newline> <newline> The Eldar Race offered humanity technology and knowledge that would save their world and expand their minds . They adapted well with these new tools . With this assistance they expanded their Mars colony into an industrial center and spaceport . Their population exploded with the introduction of terraforming , allowing humans to quickly populate new planets and spread rapidly . <newline> <newline> With this came the caveat , they would provide enforcement and security for the galaxy . <newline> <newline> Humanity agreed to this single demand and began training a force , there were soon entire planets devoted to producing these exceptional soldiers . Planets churned out machinery and ships while others produced sailors and soldiers . They began to adapt technology into bio-mechanical implants to improve chosen members of their society . <newline> <newline> The first human security fleet worked exactly as planned , the other races even admitted ( grudgingly ) that the plan would work . <newline> <newline> The Eldar did not reveal their true purpose until the arrival of the second and third fleet . <newline> <newline> Humanity wiped out six of the most venerable and ancient races in the first year . They did not take slaves or captives , they slaughtered them . They began terraforming planets in sectors that were once controlled by the Eldar council . Too late they realized their flaw . <newline> <newline> Humanity drove a spear through the galaxy , so rapid was their expansion that there was not a single race prepared for their rise to power . <newline> <newline> The rise of the warrior races followed this and thus the descent into war . <newline> <newline> Chapter 2 : Human Combatants <newline> <newline> From the diary of Tyrus E'lrich : Humans are a unique breed of alien . They can survive the most devastating of wounds but many perish when they go to war . Such is the dedication of a human to the conflict that millions may perish but they will still charge on . <newline> <newline> Humans rapidly divided themselves into factions of specialized warfare . <newline> <newline> `` Regiments '' carry out ground warfare , numbering in the tens of thousands they move with singular chaotic purpose supported by heavy tanks and bringing with them millions of rounds of ammunition for heavy weapons and rifles . <newline> <newline> The human `` Navy '' brings enormous crafts of war against their enemies , often launching thousands of smaller `` fighters '' from within these behemoths or unleashing untold amounts of ammunition against planetary targets . <newline> <newline> `` Special Forces '' units are some of the most terrifying human weapons brought against any race . These units are without fear or compassion , they often attack deep behind any frontline and can cause untold mayhem and devastation . <newline> <newline> A notable example of these units in action is the Battle of Fortis Seven , where Special Forces units completely disabled the planetary defense network , breaking a two-year stalemate in four hours . <newline> <newline> ***** <newline> <newline> `` Hear that boys ? '' Second Lieutenant Callahan said , tossing the half charred book aside , `` we even got a special mention ! '' <newline> <newline> The forty men in the dropship laughed and cheered , thumping fists against their armor or slamming the butts of their rifles into the heavy steel of the ship . <newline> <newline> `` Drop in ten ! '' the pilot shouted , sticking his head out from the cockpit where the men could see the nearly infinite amount of anti-air fire coming from the planet surface . Blue lights lanced across the sky , trying desperately to stop the endless tide of ships . <newline> <newline> `` Alright boys ! Mission ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Kill the xenos ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Damn right ! '' <newline> <newline> The ship barely slowed to let the heavy bay doors open , disgorging the forty soldiers from the belly of the ship into thin air . <newline> <newline> They fell towards the ground , dodging the incoming fire as best they could . Each man hit the ground with a tremendous *thump* , creating a small crater and creating a screen of dirt and dust . <newline> <newline> They came out firing , shredding the defenders with precise auto-fire from their heavy rifles . Troopers with shoulder mounted launchers started firing their precise payloads at the massive anti-air installations that were keeping the Fleet Majoris from entering atmosphere and lending much needed support . <newline> <newline> Before they could reload the next drop came , sending down troopers in powered armor , the heavy suits toting the heavy weapons . The wave moved forward in unison , cutting down the defenders as they did . <newline> <newline> Callahan sent a message out over the radio and his platoon laughed as they continued pushing forward . <newline> <newline> `` So much for their pacifist nature . Kill 'em all . '' <newline> <newline> ***** <newline> <newline> Callahan sat on the burnt out shell of an Eldar vehicle , their oldest allies had now become the last enemy worth fighting . <newline> <newline> His men had done their job , when the anti-air installations had come down so had the last hope for holding back the humans . Not much hope to begin with , they would have just sent another fleet . <newline> <newline> This was it . Humans win . <newline> <newline> There would n't be a final chapter in the annals of Eldar history on mankind . It would simply cease to be . Callahan found that to be a fairly sobering thought . <newline> <newline> He flicked his cigarette into the earth and jumped down , calling for his platoon to form up . There would be clean up operations , Eldar buried in their bunkers and secret facilities they would have to burn out . <newline> <newline> A nearly perceivable distance away a new threat wakened . Fearsome brutes that thirsted for blood woken by the ripples of war . Xenos that only knew consumption , breeding on the genetic matter of other life forms and thriving on death and destruction . The ever-lingering and consuming depravity of the void of space always haunting the edge of man 's mind , seeking to create new horrors and monstrosities . <newline> <newline> These creeping forces moved towards humanity and their newly forged empire . <newline> <newline> Blood will always have blood .\n","105":"`` So we 're down 10 foolish souls from last month , the spike trap is getting duller by the day , and blood 'donations ' are down 30 % from the previous week .

'' <newline> <newline> `` Sir , if I may..

Sire Crag 's far fetched modern philosophies will only increase our problems . Tradition will always be the right path . It 's what our fathers before have done , and it 's held up just fine . '' Barowyn the Dark Wizard , advisor to the Dark Lord had a certain distaste for Crag , jealous of his position in Malucin 's cabinet . `` I have seen the future , and all we need is a dragon ! Adventurers love dragons ! We 'll have them wandering in by the thousands . '' <newline> <newline> `` Tredar SMASH puny mortals ! ! '' Tredar was an incredibly large but stupid behemoth , in charge of , well as he puts it , Smashy Things . `` Tredar crush all adventurers , then they come in . '' <newline> <newline> `` QUIET all of you ! '' Malucin roared as fire bellowed from his wings and mouth . `` I have heard your suggestions , but it is time we consider budget cuts . I wo n't have this business go down in flames because we ca n't get a few knights in shining armor through the gates . If we take a little from each chamber we should be able to still function . It just wo n't be the same . I need something that can really get the people going ! Something..something that could flood these rooms with eager participants . But what ... . '' <newline> <newline> Then from the corner of the room , a small voice spoke up . It came from Fangor , a demon servant to the Dark Lord . `` My lord ... .have you considered an outside hire ? '' The voice vanished as softly as it had come . Fangor was the smallest of his demon brothers and was made well aware of it . <newline> <newline> `` Why you ... '' Barowyn raised his staff as it started to glow a deep crimson . `` How dare you enter his Dark Lord 's chambers uninvited ! I will cast you back to the pits from which you came ! '' Just as Barowyn was about to strike , Malucin jumped in front of it and absorbed the blow , a mere itch to him . <newline> <newline> `` Stop Barowyn ! The little imp may have a point . It 's at least the one sensible idea that has been spoken this entire meeting . You there , demon . What is your name ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Fangor sir , son of Deaddrift the Foul , servant to your Dark Lordship . '' Fangor cowered down in fear , Malucin looming over him , analyzing each part of him .

There were so many places I wanted to visit , like the Vatican , and the Louvre , and the top of Mount Stromboli . I mean , I 'd _been_ to all those places , but I was never really _there_ , if that makes sense . I was always just passing through on work , I 'd stopped at all these places , I have stamps in my passport from all over the world . So many . But I 'd never actually stopped to look around . I was always busy going from one client to the next , I barely ever had time to stop and think about what I was doing . I wanted to see so much , but I 've only got one day to do it . And then I realized that just looking at places was n't what I wanted to do . I wanted to see things . Experience things . Doing nothing but looking was n't the right way to spend what little time I had . And so I started think about what I wanted to do . I figured I could try some fine dining , maybe stop at that tasty Mexican place where Pedro slipped and poured oil on himself and actually take the time to enjoy the food . When I had been there before , I only had time to grab a block of goat cheese and a few peppers before I had to get to San Francisco and pick up Andrew after he got hit by a bus . But what else would I do ? I could n't just spend the whole day eating . _Just think of all the calories._ Ew . And then it hit me . I could ask Elise to dinner . Just pop on down to Xenor and we could get some nice fondue or something . Maybe see a movie . But she never got back to me , I guess she was just too busy and never saw my email , or maybe she just got too busy and got to reply . Which sucks , but I can understand . Xenor is n't quite as busy a place as Earth , because they 've gotten past the whole 'killing each other ' thing , but it is still a lot of work . For example , she actually has enough free time to sit down and eat dinner . <newline> <newline> But now , the day is finally here . I almost had a panic attack when I woke up this morning , because I was actually asleep . I stopped in Florence , and got coffee and a little pastry at a cafe near the Duomo for breakfast . I took the tour while I munched on my food . I had never realized just how delicious flaky foods were . You could feel them melt in your mouth while you chewed . But it was n't long after the tour ended that I realized just how much I wanted to do , and how long I had . 24 hours just was n't enough . I just stood there , my head spinning . THEN I realized that I was wasting my time sitting there trying to decide what to do , and I started panicking . What would I do ? What to see ? What to eat ? What to hear ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I started running down the streets of Florence , hastily shopping and seeing the sights , and two hours later I was gone , making my way to London to see Big Ben , and have a proper English breakfast . Sure , I might be killing my diet , but today was the day , of all days , to splurge . I scarfed down the meal like I had n't eaten in years , and hurried around the city for hours . '' <newline> <newline> `` As I was hurriedly deciding where to go next , I booked it to Atlanta so I could see the sights there and get some good Barbeque , and it was on my way there that I realized . I was more stressed out on my day off than I was on my workdays . I could barely remember what I 'd done today , and my goal was to have memorable experiences . So , when I got to Atlanta I made my way to here . And now I 'm six wonderful different beers in , and I 've decided that not matter what happens , I 'm going to make sure that my day off is _relaxing_ , like it should be . '' <newline> <newline> The patron next to me stared at me for a few moments , bewiledered . `` You probably never expected a simple 'How do you do ' to lead to such a rant , but there you have it . Sorry . Usually in my line of work I spend the majority of my conversations just answering questions and hearing people bitch about how unfair things are . '' <newline> <newline> My drinking buddy next to me nodded his head and took a swig of his drink . `` I can understand that , man . People can be really self-centered assholes sometimes . But it is pretty awesome that you 've been all over the world with your work , even if you do n't get to fully appreciate it . What exactly _do_ you do , buddy ? It sounds like an awesome job .

Mind you though I am not the most eloquent with my words . <newline> <newline> Dear Dad , <newline> <newline> I miss you ! I know our relationship is n't what it used to be and I am sorry , I never should have let my relationship with ____ come between us . When you moved in with me after years of being apart all I wanted was for us to bond and work on our problems we had . And instead , I allowed ____ to rule my life . Between you two fighting and us arguing about what I should be doing I sided with her every time , pushing us further and further apart . For that I am sorry . <newline> <newline> I am also writing you to apologize for all the times I have disappointed you . Not showing up with out calling when we had plans . Not helping you more when you desperately needed it . Not being the son I should have been . For kicking you out because she was n't comfortable with you in the house . For being the worst man I could have possibly been . I am so sorry . <newline> <newline> Words can not describe how terrible I feel every day for letting you down so often , for betraying you . I wish there was something I could do now to change all of the mistakes and poor decisions I made . I regret everything . <newline> <newline> I miss you Dad .

One would think to that of George Orwell 's 1984 , however this is arguably much worse . <newline> <newline> Your every move is shared on Good Ol ' Zuck 's domain . Time of waking , what you 're eating for breakfast , what TV channel you 're watching - You get the point . <newline> <newline> It 's been like this for a while , but at least back in the old days it was just vaguely embarrasing that everything you did could be found out . This was back when the US existed . Since then , it 's just been the United States of Zuckworld . I know , Mark does n't seem to be good at names does he ? <newline> <newline> Nowadays everything you do can be held against you . At birth ( which is put on your mother 's timeline as you would guess ) , you are implanted with a chip which connects you to Facebook - your name is randomly generated , your characteristics automatically entered into your personal details . This also means nothing is sacred - masturbation is nearly non existent , unless you 're shameless . Maybe you 'd think , oh , everyone does it , why does it matter ? Well , you see , it is n't nice to see your dong being shared around on your feed . <newline> <newline> This also causes crime to be wiped out - a good thing , mind you , but what is considered crime now is the catch . Swearing lands you 10 years in solitary , speaking against the state is death , and having any opinion not approved by Facebook as well as making dead memes is punishable by being exiled to the state of 9gag ( modern day Africa ) . <newline> <newline> So here I am , driven to suicide . Well , deleting my Facebook account . No difference . <newline> I have nothing to live for . I was left parentless when my mom made a Harambe joke and my dad laughed at it . They were sent to the bowels of 9gag ( modern day Zimbabwe ) . My 2 siblings were killed resisting my parent 's exile , leaving me to fend for myself . What 's even the point . Zuck rules with an iron fist , and the concept of liberty have been long forgotten by society . <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure you would like to delete your Facebook account ? '' <newline> <newline> Yes . <newline> <newline> I hear a knock on my door .\n","109":"I hurried across the parking lot and stopped when I saw the protesters . They must have been here for hours already , though the sun was only barely over the horizon . Slogans ranging from \u201c IRON IS TORTURE \u201d and \u201c SAVE THE UNICORNS \u201d were shaken by howling humans in costumes . One of them had a genuine-looking winged horse primary feather sticking up from a headband . The feather was tattered and as long as my arm , its silver-on-white banding dulled by the death of its original owner . The hypocrisy turned my stomach , and I clutched my satchel to my chest , tucked my shoulder , and pushed past them without meeting any eyes . <newline> <newline> Their hostile body language made it clear they wanted to stop me , but they let me pass . Ever since the first Fairy Incursion , people have begun re-learning the old traditions , sometimes the hard way . They were allowed their protest . But they could not impede guests of this place . I was on their side , somewhat , but they wouldn \u2019 t have believed me . <newline> <newline> Once I was past the building \u2019 s security checkpoint , my guide showed me to a small room . \u201c The hosts of this place offer their Hospitality , \u201d the guide told me quietly , taking up a post near the door . The room was better suited to a family dining room than a corporate office , with a large wooden table against the wall . The 'Hospitality ' on offer consisted of a box of glazed donuts , a carafe of coffee , and for those in a hurry , a cheese and cracker tray . <newline> <newline> As much as I wanted to take my time , I stacked a cracker with a slice of orange cheese food product and a chunk of pepperoni , then shoved it in my mouth , chewing rapidly . The cracker would count as bread and salt , it would have been enough on its own , but I was hungry . A smidge of cheese and meat might tide me over to lunch . I delayed a moment to dispense a few mouthfuls of coffee into one of the paper cups , slugging it down like a shot . <newline> <newline> The guide had waited patiently , nodding as I returned . Some people took advantage of Hospitality rooms , but I \u2019 d prefer to just get to business . I was a guest here now , with all the rights and privileges that meant . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> <newline> After a quick round of introductions in the boardroom , I began the presentation . <newline> <newline> The first few slides were a review of the company \u2019 s problem , the one they \u2019 d hired me to fix . I showed them a map of the region with a zone highlighted in pale purple . \u201c As you know , this Fairy Forest replaced a neighborhood called Bluebird Estates a little over one month ago . The authorities managed to extract the majority of the humans trapped by this Incursion , the existing infrastructure remains intact , but your property remains inoperable . <newline> <newline> \u201c In my initial assessment , I determined that this new Forest is ruled by one Queen Allwyn. \u201d The following slide showed a brief pencil sketch of the queen\u2014the higher-class fairies hate having their photos taken , considering it the theft and capturing of light , forcing it into a static image . Art , however , is another matter . <newline> <newline> \u201c To briefly review our previous meeting , Allwyn descends from the Irish Fair Folk , but her flavor is mischief rather than outright hostility. \u201d She \u2019 d seemed disappointed that I understood the rules for dealing with fairies , but once I established my credentials , she seemed pleased that I was her negotiator . <newline> <newline> \u201c In the past weeks , this has become clear , especially as the refugees have not suffered ill effects . The City is denying petitions to Raze the Forest , and the Perimeter Zone is being constructed as we speak. \u201d I heard a heavy sigh from somewhere in the room . The ideal situation for this company and many others was getting rid of the Fairies and their Forest entirely . <newline> <newline> \u201c With that established , I opened negotiations with Allwyn on your behalf. \u201d The following screen listed off the company \u2019 s requests . \u201c First , you requested that your equipment be allowed to function when it crosses through her territory , and the information carried by your cables be unaltered both entering and leaving . This is something she is willing to allow for a modest fee. \u201d There was some rumbling in the room as the company \u2019 s leaders shifted and made soft , irritated noises . I could understand their discontent , but continued . <newline> <newline> \u201c I will discuss her counter-requests momentarily . Second , you wish access to your cables where they cross through her territory , for maintenance and repairs as necessary . This one is trickier , but she seems amenable to working out a deal . <newline> <newline> \u201c And third , the restoration of your field technician , Henry Connor , and his vehicle , equipment , and effects. \u201d I flicked to a slide of the technician , a smiling , stout fellow standing in front of a blank blue background . They had not provided this image , I managed to get it from the Tech of the Month wall . This was the important one to me . The company was primarily concerned with saving the company from the Fairies . I was interested in saving the people . <newline> <newline> \u201c I have some good news here ; Mr. Connor \u2019 s case is soon to be resolved , he will be released , sanity and equipment intact , on August 28th , the fortieth day following the Incursion , or approximately eight days from now . Queen Allwyn has agreed to this as a show of good faith ; the remaining inhabitants of Bluebird Estates will also be permitted to leave with what belongings they can carry or carry in their vehicles , on that same date. \u201d <newline> <newline> That resulted in a more pleased rumble from my audience . I held in a sigh and turned to the Queen \u2019 s demands . <newline> <newline> \u201c Now we move on to Queen Allwyn \u2019 s price for permitting access through her territory . She requests a large screen television or projector set and screen , and furniture appropriate for a modern \u2018 home theater. \u2019 \u201d My slide showed a photograph of what seemed to be a natural cave ; it had been part of Bluebird Elementary \u2019 s auditorium . <newline> <newline> Luckily , school had not been in session when the Fairies took over . Getting unattended children out of their hands was difficult . I followed this with a photograph that showed the same cave , but with a ghostly illusion of a giant television , a sofa , and speakers superimposed over it . Glamour does not show up well on film . Perhaps that is why they do not want photographs of themselves . <newline> <newline> \u201c She will be negotiating separately with the power company and other utilities , but it is within her abilities to provide the power source for this equipment as necessary . She also requests the full premium cable package , all channels , movies on-demand , and the works , plus the highest-speed internet you offer . She said she will be obtaining her computer equipment elsewhere. \u201d <newline> <newline> I could see some of the company \u2019 s brass exchange incredulous looks . <newline> <newline> \u201c And as far as network maintenance \u2026 \u201d I paused . \u201c Her request there is that technicians bring her an offering every visit , including the initial service call to install and activate her service . Her current request stands at a half-gallon of fresh , unpasteurized milk , a full loaf of bread\u2014uncut , home-baked , whole-wheat\u2014and a box of Orville Redenbacher \u2019 s extra-buttery Microwave Popcorn. \u201d <newline>\n","110":"It was just an ordinary day . People always will do stupid things with their technology , so I was confident I would have this job as long as I needed it . But did I ever hate it . When I applied , I thought it would be mentally stimulating with some time for homework on the side . But being the front desk worker bored me . I had hours to fill , after homework was done . <newline> <newline> Anyways , it was just an ordinary day . I helped people with their problems , wrote a paper about the power of words , and stared at the three tiny dots on the wall across from my desk . Were they pen marks ? Anomalies in the paint ? It 's sad that l wasted so much time on those three dots , but what else was there to do ? <newline> <newline> I heard someone walking up to the door . Immediately , I was annoyed . Sure , it was my job , but I was staring at dots on a wall and they would be interrupting me . The door opened ; someone walked in . Not all that unusual , but I could n't see who it was from my desk . I stood up . <newline> <newline> Just a kid . No big deal . Boring as the rest of my day . He did n't need any help , though I asked politely . He was n't lost - his dad probably worked in the same building . It seemed he was just as bored as I was . However , I was not about to hang out with a faculty brat . <newline> <newline> He just sat on one of the chairs nearby . I had no reason to ask him to leave , so I did n't . He sat there for the rest of my shift . He left when I did ; I figured that would be the last time I saw him . Completely forgot about him , as a matter of fact . <newline> <newline> He started showing up for my shifts pretty regularly . He would show up , sit down , and leave when I did . He did n't bother me in any way . One day , he asked what I was staring at . I explained , feeling a bit foolish . <newline> <newline> He only asked me one question a day at first . What my papers were about , why that professor annoyed me , why I looked tired , why I did n't bring my energy drink that day . I answered him , but only because there was nothing better to do . The questions were superficial enough that I did n't really care . <newline> <newline> One day , I asked him a question . He loved this stupid red shirt I wore maybe every couple of weeks . Such a weird thing to latch onto , but everything about this kid was weird . Eventually , I asked him more and more questions . <newline> <newline> We started having conversations , still only about superficial things . But at least I was n't bored , staring at dots . Now I was annoyed by job related interruptions because I was having a conversation . Weeks went by , and I actually figured out quite a bit about this kid . He was a decent person , too . Of course , he was weird and I did n't really like him being there . <newline> <newline> By midterms , he was helping me study for my tests . I would never have asked , but if he wants to , who am I to stop him ? By thanksgiving break , I let him know I was one of the few people staying on campus . If he did n't have anything better to do , he could come to my room and hang out . He took me up on my offer a few times , but we did n't bond or anything . Me , a college junior , bonding with a kid ? Ridiculous . <newline> <newline> He helped me study for my finals , even though I insisted that I was fine on my own . Leaving for Christmas break was weird , almost as though I was abandoning him . I definitely pushed that thought away - I had sleep to catch up on , a holiday to celebrate , and a new nephew to meet . <newline> <newline> We talked about what happened in our lives while I was gone . He asked to see pictures ; I relented about letting him behind the desk . After that , he just moved his chair when he came in . I guess it 's at that point that we started sharing more personal stuff . Just little things though , nothing huge or scary for a kid . <newline> <newline> My job became less boring with him around , admittedly . I did n't feel brain dead after my shifts . By spring break , I considered him my little shadow . Always helpful , quiet when I had stuff to do , and overall a really good kid . One day , I began to probe a little about his life . Turns out , neither of his parents worked in the building . <newline> <newline> Days with him were the new normal . I think I probably would have been concerned if he had n't showed up . I definitely was n't attached ; I did n't even know his name . So when my boss walked in , it was just an ordinary day . <newline> <newline> He noticed the kid , but only spoke to me . Over the summer , they were eliminating my job . Restructuring and making technology more accessible crap . He offered me a different position , more hands-on . I said I 'd get back to him ; he left . The kid was silent for a bit . Not unusual , but I felt a compulsion to explain that I would n't work here anymore . <newline> <newline> He helped me study for finals again . On my second to last shift , I looked forward to seeing him . I wanted to know why he kept hanging out with me and what his name was . He did n't show . Whatever , I reminded myself , I was n't attached . <newline> <newline> My last shift came around . He was back ; it was an ordinary day again . I postponed my questions , knowing this was our last time to hang out . Besides , it seemed like he had more than enough questions for me . He wanted to know all about my years in high school . So I told him . Because I was held back in elementary , I was a bit older than my classmates . I had dated a few senior girls my freshman year , but that 's the only advantage my age had given me . He seemed especially interested in my description of Julie , but any guy would be especially interested in her . Describing her reminded me of how good that 3 months were . I made a mental note to look her up on facebook , see what she was up to . <newline> <newline> After exhausting his questions , I asked mine . He said that when he came that first day , I did n't really look like I wanted to be bothered . So he waited . And he was planning on waiting some more , but this was my last day . And he did n't think I would be bothered by him anymore . I agreed , thinking he had some dumb technology question he was too nervous to ask about . He certainly looked nervous , so I figured I would ask him a few more questions . He was 6 and his name was Eric . I encouraged him to say whatever was on his mind . <newline> <newline> `` You know when we were talking about Julie ? She 's still really nice , I promise . She told me about you . And well , you sounded like a really cool person . So I wanted to meet you . And then I just kept coming back , because you are really cool . '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're pretty cool yourself , dude . But one last question . Where were you yesterday ? My shift was weird without all your questions . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , my mom figured out that I was hanging out with you . She did n't like that so much , so she said I could n't come anymore . But after today I wo n't see you anymore . '' <newline> <newline> I wanted to scold him for not obeying his mom , but I could hear footsteps outside the door , knowing it would open any second . I figured he 'd probably hear it from his mom when he got home , anyways . To my great amusement at the coincidence , Julie from high school walked in . I had no idea she attended here , but I was happy to see her and help with any problem she had . <newline> <newline> `` May I help you , ma'am ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , I 'm looking for my son . Apparently he 's been hanging out around here quite a bit . He disappeared today and I 'm guessing he came here . His name is Eric , have you seen him ? ''\n","111":"`` I think being a vegetarian was a missed steak , Tara . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? Being a vegetarian is amazing !

Birds were capable of speech . They did n't use it for much , mainly mating and instructions to gather food . Whereas humans had built a silent civilization . Communication was done via body signs . Mostly people did their own things and did n't engage with others . <newline> <newline> I landed on the outskirts of a big city , next to a large tree . The tree was loud , louder than New York on rush hour . It was mating season . I covered my ears and headed towards the city . At the time I was confused , I needed a human to talk to . <newline> <newline> As I arrived , the town was quiet . It was midday , there were n't that many cars . The streets were relatively empty . A sense of slight loneliness hit me . I walked around the streets , counting the people for some reason . Then I finally gathered up the courage and asked a person : `` Hey , how 's it going ? '' I asked that from a quite old person , around his 60-s maybe . He got a shock and collapsed . Over the street , people noticed the old man collapsing and me trying to help him , they rushed to help . People ignored the fact , that I can speak and were keen on getting the man into a hospital . The ambulance arrived . I did n't see or hear anybody calling them , they just came . I was confused , the experience was completely silent . Nobody communicated . The ambulance rushed back to the hospital . <newline> After the man got his help , people started picking on me . They stared me down , pointing at me and using signs that I did n't understand . Eventually another force appeared , the police . They arrested me , I co-operated as I needed somebody to talk to . Why were everyone silent ? <newline> <newline> I was put in a cell for a few hours until an investigator came . He started using signs that I did n't understand . They differed greatly from the sign languages back home . I was given a piece of paper and a pen for some reason . I quickly wrote : `` I ca n't understand you . I 'm from elsewhere . '' on the paper and showed it to him . To my surprise he understood and wrote me back while asking for more paper in signs . He asked : `` why ca n't you understand basic communication ? '' I hoped he would maybe understand me when I talk and talked , but he was just amazed . The birds were the only creatures capable of speech . And now a human ? I understood his amazement and wrote him : `` what 's going to happen to me ? '' He answered : `` Sadly , due to the murder of an elder and mysterious acts of speech , death sentence . '' Did the man really die ? Was it so bad ? Where the hell did I appear ? I was furious and broke my pen . He wrote to me : `` The sentence will be carried out in a week . '' I could n't wait . In this silenced world , there were no cellmates to talk to . I did n't actually know this , but I thought so . In anger , I grabbed one of the guards ' guns and shot myself , hoping I 'd wake up back home . I did n't .\n","113":"The crank radio continued to switch between the EAS system and whatever was still in the pre-selected rotation at the classic rock station . The Top 40 stations were the first to go days after the initial bombings ; We had all agreed that it was the one good thing to come out of this situation . If we had to be held up in our double-wide trailer in the middle of the woods until the government gave the all clear , I 'm glad that I could at least have the company of familiar music . <newline> <newline> I had made the three hour journey home when I first heard the stories of the sickness .

No way . <newline> <newline> Dad was another story . <newline> <newline> Dad was prepared for this kind of shit . <newline> <newline> The guy never served in the military , he was just a huge nerd about that sort of thing . Even though we were considered poor by just about everyone 's standards he always seemed to bring home some sort of new weapon every two weeks or so . WWII M1 Garand ? Yup . Civil War era rifle ? Totes . Bazooka ? It did n't work , but yup . AK-47 ? One Israeli , two Russian . Thank God that my parents were rednecks . If there was one person that would be ecstatic in the event of the zombie apocalypse , it was my father . <newline> <newline> I guess I thought it would entail more than just sitting on the couch , keeping our German Shepherd occupied and listening to my younger brother lament about not being able to do anything . The kid had been staring at his dead iPhone off and on for two weeks now . Ted Nugent 's 'Strangehold ' was playing for the fourth time that day . I could read , but the candlelight hurt my eyes , and the spoiled dog in front of me would start crying if I did n't throw her slobbery squeaky toy . <newline> <newline> The door opened to Mom running in , clad in her Carhart overalls and hunting rifle still in hand . `` The tornado siren is going off in New Providence .

'' he muttered , throwing the ball towards the other end of the room . <newline> <newline> I opened the door to see that Dad was n't asleep , but sitting on the edge of the waterbed with several of his guns surrounding him . I would 've expected them to be in various states of cleaning , but they were all assembled and seemingly ready to go . of all things , the Russian AK with the folding stock seemed to be freshly polished . Yet Dad was sitting there with his face in his hands . <newline> <newline> `` Dad , are you okay ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't do it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh come on ! How could you not be geared up and ready to go for the zombie onslaught ? You 've been waiting for this ! '' I exclaimed . My brother made some noises of what could only be described as offended surprise . <newline> <newline> He looked up at me in confusion . `` What ? No ! Not that ! Not that at all ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Then what ca n't you do ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't pick which one I want use . There 's too many and they 're all fun . '' <newline> <newline> The muffled sound of a siren , the 'Strangehold ' guitar solo , and our dog 's soft whining filled the gap between my surprised silence and my mother screaming obscenities over hearing Dad 's response . <newline> <newline> -- -- - <newline> ( First time filling out one of these . Yay . ) <newline>\n","114":"It was a rerun of a show I had always meant to watch . It was a marathon so I figured I would catch up . Friends had always told me to read the book but who wants to spend their time reading books all the time ? Now I wish I had . <newline> <newline> `` We are getting word that impact will be in ... Jesus ... three..three hours ... '' <newline> <newline> I heard a mixture of screams and laughing from various neighbors , people freaking out from the news or thinking it was a joke , something told me it was n't . <newline> <newline> `` We wish you the best and it has been our honor to bring you the news for these past years ... God bless and if there is a next life- '' <newline> <newline> The tv signal went to a `` Experiencing technical difficulties '' screen . Guess they cut him off because they did n't want to offend a bunch of people right before they died , typical liberal news . <newline> <newline> I sat there for a few minuets . What the heck ? Are they not going to resume the show ? <newline> <newline> I needed to know what happened , who killed Tyrian , will Ariana stay queen , what about the army of white walkers destroying the northern wall ? So much unanswered question ! <newline> <newline> I had two episode left ! I paced the room waiting for the screen to change , people outside were rioting , burning cars or breaking windows . I can not die like this ! Not knowing the ending my friends kept telling me was `` the best in television history ! '' I needed resolution ! <newline> <newline> I looked at my computer , I could torrent it ... <newline> <newline> I ran to my computer and opened my browser , closed it again and then opened incognito mode . I typed in some obscure website , typed in the name of the show and pressed download . <newline> <newline> `` CRAP ! '' The download said `` 2.5 hours remaining '' I could n't download these episodes at this speeds and be able to finish them by the time- my neighbor ! He had just upgraded to google fiber , I needed to connect and I could finish the download and watch the episode with minutes to spare . <newline> <newline> Of course it was secure , selfish jerk . I grabbed my laptop and ran upstairs and banged on the door , he slowly opened the door <newline> <newline> `` what is your internet password ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` What the heck is your password ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` ... for the internet ? Do you not know wha- '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes yes yes world ending blah blah blah just tell me ! '' <newline> <newline> `` abc123 '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` ... '' <newline> <newline> `` You have got to be kidding me . '' <newline> <newline> I sat down on his couch and typed the password in and the download finished in a few minuets , yes I finally can finish the show ! <newline> <newline> I heard a loud bang and a flash from the other room . <newline> <newline> `` Keep it down in there I 'm trying to watch my show ! '' <newline> <newline> I sat there for the last 86 minuets of the best show I had ever watched , the finally the best story telling of our generation . Every twist and plot execution was astounding ! <newline> <newline> I stood up and looked out the window , a fiery ball was forming in the night sky . I looked at my phone there were 124 missed calls and 86 texts of family and friends telling me to call them to see if I was alright . <newline> <newline> I rang my mom . <newline> <newline> `` Jackie is that you ? ? Dear god where are you it 's ... i ... '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's alright mom I finished , cold fingers takes the throne and the dragons kill all the white walkers , it was the best ending ever ! '' <newline> <newline> There was silence for a few seconds . <newline> <newline> `` Dammit Jackie spoile- ''\n","115":"Caveats : <newline> <newline> * Not 100 % following the prompt but I believe I hit most of it . <newline> * I 'm drunk and trying to express myself for the first time ( never wrote a short story to the end before , EXCITING ! : D ) <newline> * I did n't go through and edit this because I 'm just so eager to see people critique it . <newline> <newline> I 'm very sorry if this is n't what you wanted but this is what came out from your prompt . <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> \u201c How the fuck could you do that ? ! \u201d Kari screamed in anger . <newline> <newline> Others in the cafeteria were starting to stare at my girlfriend as she made a scene . I could hear whispers , accusing me of this and that . Whatever . <newline> <newline> The truth was I wanted to hurt her more than she 'd ever been emotionally . I wanted to make her feel insignificant . As bad I made myself feel when I thought about all the stress I was being subjected to if it came down to it . I was better than her and I was going to make her feel it . If it meant I had to lie about a few things to get my point across , then so be it . She was going to know exactly who the one in control was . <newline> <newline> \u201c Mike , you 're not seriously thinking about\u2014 \u201c <newline> <newline> \u201c It 's been going on for months , Kari . I 'm honestly kind of embarrassed for you that you did n't see this coming . What did you think all that time spent over at Red Rocks was for ? \u201d <newline> <newline> Her eyes were red and swollen with tears . It made me feel so much better about myself seeing her so helpless . *Now she 'll know . You 've got her right where you want her . * <newline> <newline> \u201c I ca n't believe I thought I could see myself with you for the rest of my life ... And all this talk about being excepted to Stanford ? Was that bullshit too ? <newline> <newline> *Who the fuck are you to question me about that , you cunt ? * <newline> <newline> I flew into a rage . \u201c What are you , my mom all of a sudden ? Making me feel like shit if I do n't make it into on her alma mater ? Have you ever thought that I may not want to go to college , Kari ? \u201d At this , she was visibly taken aback but quickly redoubled with anger . <newline> <newline> \u201c But why tell me you're\u2014 \u201c <newline> <newline> \u201c What if my dream is to just sit on my ass and do nothing all day ? What if I only want to smoke pot , read books , listen to music , and play video games ? Would you still be with me ? Or are you too fucking shallow to give a shit about a person who does n't have aspirations like you ? Those fucks over in Providence already making you like them , huh ? \u201d Just thinking back to the day I heard about her acceptance and the facade of happiness I had to put on for her made me surge with self-loathing and humiliation . I remember thinking \u201c *there 's no way she 'll stay with a loser like you , Mike ... * \u201d <newline> <newline> She looked as bound and determined to fill me with as much pain as I had her . Her eyes bore into me with a loathing I never saw before , even through her tears . I could see how much she wanted to cut me deep . <newline> <newline> \u201c I am so sorry that I spent the last two years of my life thinking I 'd be Mrs. Edmonds by the time we graduated . I 'm sorry I must have been a burden being by your side , day and night , when your dad was in the hospital . <newline> <newline> \u201c But mostly , \u201d she said before giving an audible sob , \u201c I 'm sorry I never was good enough for you. \u201d She swallowed . \u201c If Lisa hears about you and Stanford , god help you . If you die tomorrow , no one will miss you . Least of all , me. \u201d <newline> <newline> And there was the deep cut . Even with all of my walls I put up , it was n't enough for me to keep my composure . Kari blurred out of my vision as I shut my eyes and heard all sorts of derision from onlookers . <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> Last block came and went as slowly as it possibly could . I dealt with a lot whispers and quick glances in my direction most of class . Mr. Koepezzy stopped me as I was shuffling out of class . <newline> <newline> \u201c Is everything ok , Mike ? \u201d <newline> <newline> I sniffled . \u201c Sure , Mr. K. , why would n't they be ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c You do n't look good , is what I mean . Everything okay at home ? \u201d He took a seat on top of his desk . <newline> <newline> \u201c You mean before of after Dad died ? \u201d <newline> <newline> Mr. K 's face flushed but he ignored that . \u201c You 've obviously been crying , Mike . What happened ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I said some stuff to Kari about where I wanted to be in life and how I planned on getting there. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I take it she did n't like what you had to say ? \u201d <newline> <newline> *No , dipshit . * \u201c No , \u201d I said . <newline> <newline> \u201c How mad is she ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Mad enough to wan na kill me. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Jesus , that 's bad. \u201d He stared down at his Stafford wingtips and blinked a few times . <newline> <newline> \u201c You going to apologize to her ? \u201d <newline> <newline> My anger flashed . \u201c For what ? I did n't say anything wrong . If anything I 'm the one who should should be apologized to . How the hell would you know about what happened anyhow ? \u201d <newline> <newline> A look of annoyance came over Mr. K. \u201c One , do n't swear in my classroom . I heard enough of that stuff when I was in . Two , do n't air your dirty laundry out at lunch for the whole school to hear every word . You may think you 're a clever kid but to those of us who know what happened to your family recently , you 're just looking for a reprieve and a welcoming shoulder. \u201d <newline> <newline> He was right . And I fucking hated him for knowing exactly how I felt . It made me feel so helpless . <newline> <newline> \u201c Go and apologize to that poor girl and make up for what was said . You may have been through a lot in the last year but she 's been right there with you . Do you know how much I would love to have a wife who would do something like that for me and my family ? What you have is something they do n't even write about in books . Do n't go screwing up something beautiful for yourself , Mike. \u201d <newline> <newline> I considered this for a moment . My dad loved having her over in his hospital room . I still had pictures of her pretending to polish his bald head . I remember he told me that he hoped I 'd keep her after he was gone . <newline> <newline> \u201c ... You 're right , Mr. Koepezzy , \u201d I said and hurried out the door . <newline> <newline> \u2013 <newline> <newline> Kari worked at Greek 's Pizzeria just on the other side of the block . I was going to go there and grovel , make a big show just like I did in front of their customers and pray to whatever or whoever was up there that she 'd find it in her heart to forgive me . I 'd tell her I 'd work for a year while taking classes at community college and hopefully be able to make the jump to some state university . It sure as hell would n't be anywhere close to Stanford but it would be better than the shit I told her earlier . I 'd make myself better by doing these things and , by proxy , make myself more desirable to her . She 'd see how good I could be to her and how enriched her life would be by having me in it and how incredible a husband I could be . Just you wait . Everyone would look back on the day I broke down after a little fight in the cafeteria and remember it as the day I won her back . And the best part is that they 'd see me as well-rounded . They 'd make up excuses for me as to why I looked so soft and , after they saw how good I got her back , they 'd say oh my god , Mike is such a deep and wonderful person . I 'd show them all . <newline> <newline> I walked across the Flor Street and Hennepin Ave crossing to the opposite corner where Greek 's was and , as I did , heard a shrill scream from behind . <newline> <newline> \u201c *Goodbye , Mike ... * \u201d <newline> <newline> I turned around and saw two things : Kari 's long brown hair blowing in the wind and the grill of a black Audi moving fast to meet me .\n","116":"`` Hello ?

Thanks for reading !\n","117":"When I first met my husband , he was seven . We were at a Michaelmas Feast at our college in Oxford , Balliol , and he caught my eye across the table . I was charmed instantly ; such a defined jaw , prominent cheekbones , every hair lying in the right place . Just before the feast ended , he came over to introduce himself to me . <newline> <newline> \u201c Michael Petain \u201d he smiled . <newline> <newline> I was taken aback . In these two words I was overwhelmed by the sincerity of this man and by the sheer weight of his charisma . <newline> <newline> As time went by , Michael and I fell in love . We married on the 20th August in the church I was baptised in , a small affair with friends and family . Our gifts were nice , but probably the best one was that Michael was a three . <newline> <newline> Day in , day out , Michael \u2019 s number seemed to change . Some days , it was a zero . Some days , it was a nine . His external demeanour never seemed to be affected by the way his number sat , strangely . <newline> <newline> Our careers progressed , with myself becoming a Lecturer in French at the University of Southwark in London , and Michael being elected as a Member of Parliament for South Bermondsley . On Election Day , I noticed something strange . For the first time , his number became a deep , dark red . I thought nothing of it . It was illogical to think it would mean something . <newline> <newline> About a year after the election , Michael was given a ministerial post in the Cabinet . My husband was a Minister of State in the Department for Transport . As it tends to , time progressed , and by the time we reached our mid forties , I was a senior lecturer and Michael was Deputy Leader of the party . Life was good . We had influential friends , fancy cocktail parties and grandiose state dinners . I couldn \u2019 t have asked for anything more . <newline> <newline> When the Leader stepped down after losing the General Election , Michael was advised to stand for the position . Drawing on the same charisma that attracted me to him in the first place , he staged a powerful campaign and ended up winning with a majority of 22.3 % . I could hardly believe it . I was married to the Leader of Her Majesty \u2019 s Most Loyal Opposition . I was one of the most powerful wives in the country . Incredible . <newline> <newline> Again , time passed , and at the next election , not only did Michael hold his seat , but the party also won with a majority of 43 ! Incredible . We did celebrate that night . I \u2019 ve never drunk so much champagne in my life . <newline> <newline> The next morning , Michael and I went to move into Downing Street . One of his first tasks were the Letters of Last Resort . In the event of the British Government being unable to function in the event of a nuclear attack , the commanders of our submarine fleet were to open these letters and follow their instructions . Nobody other than the Prime Minister knew what they said until they were opened . <newline> <newline> I did though . As he was writing , I watched where the door was left ajar , and for the first time in my life , I saw a shining , obsidian black ten . <newline>\n","118":"Bertram wears his thinking cap . That 's what I call it anyway . Really , it 's just a silly little dog-sized Sherlock hat he lets me put on him as long as I give him plenty of treats first . It 's important , though . He 's my sidekick . He 's got to look the part . <newline> <newline> I put on the long , wool scarf my Nan knitted me last year . It 's red and green and blue and goes around my neck four full times , with plenty left over . I also wear a gray bowler hat . I think that came from a Halloween costume of Dad 's . It 's kinda cheap and plastic-looking , and it 's much too large , but it 's the best detective hat I could find in their closet . Last , I get my spyglass . It 's just a magnifying glass . It may have come out of a box of Trix , but it works pretty good . It makes little things big , and that 's all that matters . In fact , that 's most of what detective work *is* , says Dad . <newline> <newline> `` Finding the little things that are actually big things in disguise , '' he says . But not actually little thing . He means little *seeming* things . <newline> <newline> So Bertram is ready and so am I . It 's Friday night . Mystery Night ! <newline> <newline> Last week was a hum-*dinger* ! Mom 's necklace went missing . Her favorite one - with the turquoise stone and the rose gold heart . Not in the bedroom and not in the bathroom . Not in the house at all ! I asked the right questions , though . That 's another thing Dad always says about detecting . `` The right question makes all the difference . '' So I asked her where she 'd been and who she 'd talked to and what they 'd said and how they 'd *looked* and I figured it out ! It was the desk lady at the gym ! She 'd been very envious of Mom 's pretty necklace and she knew the code to the electronic locks in the locker room . Motive and means ! Mom and Dad drove me over to the gym and sure enough , I got the desk lady to fess up ! <newline> <newline> Of *course* I know it was all make believe . People do n't just steal from each other and laugh and give it back and say thanks and that 's that . People get arrested . Or they lie . Or they hurt each other . But it 's fun all the same and Dad says I 'm basically a pro . <newline> <newline> Anyway , I 'm ready to go ! <newline> <newline> Bertram and I come down the stairs . `` Detective Ellie Gumshoe , on the case ! '' I shout . Bertram barks to let everyone know he 's there , too . No one says anything back . <newline> <newline> I look around . The TV 's on in the living room . The lights are on in the kitchen . But I do n't see anyone around . <newline> <newline> `` Detective Ellie 's here ! '' I call . No one says anything . I turn off the TV and listen . Nothing . <newline> <newline> `` Mom ? Dad ? '' Nothing . <newline> <newline> I look at Bertram . His thinking cap 's fallen crooked on his head . `` Hey . You do n't suppose ... ? '' I run over to the living room window . It looks out on the driveway . Both cars are there . <newline> <newline> `` It 's already started , '' I say . `` You see , Bert ? *That's* the mystery . I have to find Mom and Dad . '' <newline> <newline> I start with the obvious . I go back upstairs . I look in their room . It 's empty . Not in the closet . Not under the bed . They 're not there . <newline> <newline> They are n't in the upstairs bathroom either . `` Not upstairs , '' I say to Bertram . `` So that 's eliminated . '' <newline> <newline> We go back downstairs . I check the guest bedroom . Nothing there . Nothing in the hall closet . Nothing in the living room . <newline> <newline> Okay . <newline> <newline> I decide to leave the basement for last . I do n't really like the basement . Mom and Dad know I do n't like the basement . I do n't think they 're down there . <newline> <newline> The backdoor in the kitchen is open . That 's for sure a clue . I look out at the backyard . There 's some toys out there . The lawnmower 's still out . It 's getting dark , but that 's all there is . They 're not in he backyard . <newline> <newline> Okay . <newline> <newline> I close the kitchen door . I 'll check the basement . <newline> <newline> I open the door and turn on the light . The basement smells funny as always . Like dust and old water . I point down the stairs and click my tongue . Bertram does n't go for it . He does n't like the basement either . I go down without him . <newline> <newline> The stairs are loud . Every step sounds like something 's about to break . The railing is wobbly . I make it all the way down . The ground down here is plain cement . There 's a big pile of boxes in the corner . I 'm not going to check the boxes . They would n't be in the boxes . That 's not a good mystery . I walk around . Mom 's exercise equipment is down here . The thing she runs on and the thing with all the rubber bands . I do n't remember the last time she used them . More boxes . The furnace . It 's summer , so it 's not on . The washer and dryer . <newline> <newline> I hear something ! <newline> <newline> Oh , it 's Bertram on the stairs . He comes a couple steps down and whines . <newline> <newline> Okay . They 're not down here . <newline> <newline> I go back upstairs . <newline> <newline> *Where are they ? * <newline> <newline> Okay , remember . Little things that are actually big things . Okay . <newline> <newline> I go back to the kitchen . There 's a broken glass on the counter . Wine . I think it had wine in it . Mom likes wine . She broke a glass , but did n't clean it up . Is that a clue ? That must be a clue . Why would she break a glass and not clean it up ? <newline> <newline> What else ? What else ? <newline> <newline> One of the drawers is open . Which one ? Oh . The knife drawer . I forgot which that was because I do n't ever go in that one . <newline> <newline> Okay . The knife drawer is open . Mom broke a wine glass and left it . The kitchen door was open . <newline> <newline> Think think think . Little things that are actually big things . Ask the right questions . Questions ... but who can I ask ? Mom and Dad are n't here ? <newline> <newline> I look through the kitchen window . *Mrs . Meacham ! * <newline> <newline> Mrs. Meacham lives next door . Her kitchen looks at our kitchen . Sometimes Mom will wave at her when she 's cooking . Maybe she saw something ? <newline> <newline> I walk across the lawn , but leave Bertram at home ( Mrs. Meacham does n't like dogs ) . Mrs. Meacham answers when I ring the doorbell . <newline> <newline> `` Lil ' Ellie , how are you ? '' she says . She likes me . <newline> <newline> `` Hi Mrs. Meacham , '' I say . `` I was wondering if you saw anything suspicious tonight ? Like , anything in my kitchen ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Say again , dear ? What happened in your kitchen ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Nothing , '' I say . `` But my parents are missing and I 'm collecting clues , so I wondered if maybe you ... '' <newline> <newline> `` *Missing* ? '' says Mrs. Meacham . `` You 're all alone ? What happened ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It 's a mystery , '' I explain . I 'm getting worried that Mrs. Meacham is getting worried . She does n't know about Mystery Night . `` It 's okay . I 'm trying to solve it . But all I know so far is that the backdoor was open , there 's a broken glass of wine , and the knife drawer was left open , too . So I thought maybe you might have seen or heard ... '' <newline> <newline> But Mrs. Meacham is just getting more and more worried and not really listening to me . `` Are you playing or are you telling me your parents are missing ? '' She grabs my shoulders . It kind of hurts . <newline> <newline> `` We 're playing , '' I say . `` They 're missing and I 'm trying to find them . It 's Mystery Night . '' <newline> <newline> Mrs. Meacham just shakes her head and grabs hold of my arm . `` I do n't know what 's going on . I need to talk to your parents . You 're giving me a *fright* , girl . '' <newline> <newline> She pulls me out of her house . `` But you *can't* talk to them . '' I really do n't know how to make Mrs. Meacham understand . `` They 're missing . '' She just shakes her head and drags me back to my house . <newline> <newline> We go in through the kitchen door . Bertram barks and Mrs. Meacham kicks at him . `` Get that thing away from me ! '' <newline> <newline> I lead Bertram to the bathroom and close the door . He starts howling immediately . `` It 's not a bad thing , '' I say . `` I was just looking for clues . I 'm sorry I bothered you . '' <newline> <newline> Mrs. Meacham is n't listening to me . `` Glen ? Polina ? Are you home ? Your daughter is playing strange games . Are you *here* ? '' <newline> <newline> I start to get worried about Mystery Night . If Mrs. Meacham keeps yelling and making a fuss , maybe my parents will come and I 'll never solve the mystery . And then maybe they 'll never want to do Mystery Night anymore . What if Mrs. Meacham calls the police ? What if my parents get in trouble ? <newline> <newline> `` It 's okay , '' I keep saying , chasing Mrs. Meacham around the house . `` It 's okay ! It 's just a game . It 's just a mystery . '' <newline> <newline> Mrs. Meacham searches almost exactly like I did earlier , then she shakes her head . `` This is n't right . I 'll call the police . '' <newline> <newline> `` No ! '' I shout , and I say it so loud Mrs. Meacham finally notices me again . I think fast . `` You did n't look in the basement . '' <newline> <newline> I 'm not really thinking . I 'm just scared . Scared for my parents . Scared for us . Mrs. Meacham 's really going to ruin everything . I know she is . <newline> <newline> Mrs. Meacham goes to the basement and opens the door . Bertram is still howling in the bathroom . `` What 's down there ? '' she asks me . <newline> <newline> `` Exercise stuff , '' I say . <newline> <newline> She leans over and turns on the light . `` Glen ? Polina ? You down there ? '' <newline> <newline> I barely touch her . At least , I think I barely touched her . I do n't really remember to be honest . All I remember is that she went forward and I saw her feet were n't touching anything and I slammed the door closed behind her . All I could hear was Bertram 's howling . <newline> <newline> I drag a chair over and leave it in front of the basement door . I do n't know what that does . I know I 've seen it in movies before . <newline> <newline> I let Bertram out of the bathroom . He had an accident on the bathmat . That 's okay . <newline> <newline> I go back outside and sit down on the steps . My hands are shaking . My everything is shaking . I 'm not a very good detective . <newline> <newline> I look up and see it . Why had n't I seen it before ? How come I 'd forgotten it ? <newline> <newline> I wander across the yard . Bertram follows me . We walk to the shed way down at the edge of the lawn . The door is unlocked . I push it open . <newline> <newline> `` You got us ! '' shouts Dad . <newline> <newline> `` Took you long enough , '' says Mom . She 's smiling . She 's not mad . <newline> <newline> `` I kidnapped your mom , '' says Dad . `` And then dragged her to my lair . Mwah haha ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I'd 've been finished if not for the brave and intelligent , Detective Ellie Gumshoe ! '' says Mom . `` But now I 'm famished . Dinner ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I want pizza , '' says Dad , laughing as he picks me up and hugs me to his chest . `` Wow . You 're getting big , are n't you ? '' <newline> <newline> I do n't say anything . I do n't say anything at all . <newline> <newline> He carries me back into the house .\n","119":"Janet picked her son up from his crib , heart pounding uncontrollably . She gingerly touched her marked wrist , a plain looking gray 66 hooked directly to her biometrics . Caleb would be waiting for her downstairs , ready as he could be for the appointment . His was a sleek black 62 , inked onto the inside of his left bicep , hidden away from the world ; fortunate for him to be born after the tracking process had been refined . <newline> <newline> The car was already pre-programmed , breakfast quickly fried up from the freshly printed ingredients . Caleb scooped the sausages and eggs into their antique porcelain bowls , careful to maintain a perfect and separate ratio , and they were off . Two hundred miles to the clinic . <newline> <newline> \u201c Janet , sweetheart , don \u2019 t fret . Little Emmanuel will be fine . They account for curable diseases now , you know , I read it just yesterday . No more false threes , no more terrified parents watching the counter tick to zero. \u201d <newline> <newline> Caleb smiled brightly , directing what support he could to his wife . Her gaze was fixed on the rolling scenery , the rising disc of the sun capping the mountains and draping the green hills in their autumnal coat . It would be a splendid day , all brightness and warmth . Janet felt in her core that it couldn \u2019 t be . <newline> <newline> \u201c I mean , you were a 97 yourself ! And me , 90 is a respectable age these days , though maybe a little younger than it used to be. \u201d <newline> <newline> Janet patted her sleeping son on his head , petting his blond hair . Each stroke calmed her momentarily , and then she recalled the terror of the process . <newline> <newline> \u201c Caleb , they \u2019 ll still draw blood , still perforate his skin to insert this bioelectric ink . A mandated process . Mandated by law , Caleb , and why ? I \u2019 d rather not know when anyone will die . Grandmamma still remembers way back , she never needed to get her marker . It was a freer time , no judgment of the short lived. \u201d <newline> <newline> Caleb gently touched the back of his hand to Emmanuel \u2019 s cheek . \u201c Let \u2019 s not rehash this argument Jannie . It just is . It won \u2019 t change now , and there \u2019 s still that element of unpredictability . Chemicals aren \u2019 t precognizant , you know. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I know that Caleb. \u201d Janet bit off her snappish reply and turned back out the window . <newline> <newline> Caleb muttered a few more platitudes before abandoning any attempt to soothe his wife . She would be inconsolable until it was all over , until their son was formally a legal citizen . It was wrapped up all in one handy tattoo , indeed it was , all that personal information you could ever need . Scanned , at the press of a button , at any UNE governmental facility . Nice and easy . Nice and simple . <newline> <newline> They arrived two hours later , their designated spot right at the front of the facility , kept open for their appointment . There were few other autocars in the lot , most of older make . As far as Caleb could make out , converted models . Cheaper government vehicles , dented and handed down with the job but reliable enough . Janet was sobbing when Caleb gently laid a hand on her arm . <newline> <newline> \u201c Cal , Cal ! Cal , I don \u2019 t know if I can go through with this . Just look there , look at how empty it all is . I always try to forget that most people aren \u2019 t this lucky , that they don \u2019 t , \u201d Janet choked on her words , descending into helpless racking sobs . <newline> <newline> \u201c Jannie , my love , there \u2019 s nothing for it . You know the reasons , it \u2019 s the only way we can live as comfortably as we do . A good life requires compromises. \u201d <newline> <newline> Janet swung her head violently side to side . She would be trying to rattle the memories into hiding , of the somber faces at the town hall . The losers last year , the unlucky couples left forlorn with waiting houses and empty rooms . <newline> <newline> Without another word Janet left the car . Caleb rushed to steady her and guided her to the door , Emmanuel still happily sleeping in his mother \u2019 s arms . The doors slid open before them , and the coldness of the interior reminded them immediately that this was no normal clinic . Only one entity could afford such an energy luxury , to keep an entire building cool in the sweltering summer . <newline> <newline> \u201c Ah , welcome ! \u201d <newline> <newline> A bright blond woman greeted the couple as they stumbled through the door . Her glistening smile brought them into a warmly furnished waiting room , real wooden furniture on a dark marble floor . Luscious landscapes and presidential portraits covered the walls , intent on reminding visitors of the splendor of their benefactors . As the couple inched forward , Janet leaning heavily on her husband , Caleb could begin to make out the stiff UNE uniform , molded to fit in a dark green-black . A viperous color , as Janet would say . <newline> <newline> \u201c You \u2019 re the Brandts , yes ? Here for your ten o \u2019 clock ? \u201d <newline> <newline> Janet remained mute . Caleb breathed deep enough for the two of them and nodded . <newline> <newline> \u201c Yes , we \u2019 re ready . My wife is a bit squeamish about the process , so she may choose to wait outside the room. \u201d <newline> <newline> The receptionist nodded vigorously , never wavering in her gleaming grin . <newline> <newline> \u201c Of course ! It \u2019 s a simple operation , but that is no problem at all ! Here , come right this way and Dr. Morgan will be with you in just a moment. \u201d <newline> <newline> She shuffled the couple into a bright and sterile examination room . A few metal chairs were the only unbolted furniture , with an operating table in the center and an ominous machine hanging from the ceiling . Caleb always though it to look like some sort of crustacean , but Janet disagreed . It was a spider , fangs at the ready . <newline> <newline> The doctor came in just as the family took seats . He shook hands vigorously , introducing himself with all the warmth available to the human voice , and soothed the distraught mother as best he could . Janet remained resolute , against the ushering of her husband , to stay for the procedure . <newline> <newline> It was over quicker than either remembered for their own . One prick for blood , gentle whirring in the ominous contraption , and a quick stamp where the mother indicated , on the child \u2019 s right shoulder . Quick enough to avoid the wails of distress and pain Janet had been expecting , that she remembered from her own imprinting . It would take a few hours to set , the doctor said . Something they could never figure a way to improve on , oddly enough . <newline> <newline> Son in the car , feelings soothed , the family started back home . Caleb took his son from Janet and played with him on his lap , as Janet gazed again out into the blurred scenery . <newline> <newline> \u201c Janet , it \u2019 s all over now , nothing to be worried about . Look , he \u2019 s got two numbers even ! A good sign , I \u2019 d say. \u201d <newline> <newline> Janet remained silent . The disquiet at her core remained , her distress held in check by a thread of will . They were nearly home when Janet looked to her husband and found him pale as the hospital tiling . <newline> <newline> \u201c Caleb , what \u2019 s the matter ? \u201d <newline> <newline> She knew before she looked . She grabbed their son , roughly for the first time in her life , and brought his shoulder right up to her eye . His tattoo burned brightly , red ragged edges from its freshness , but all too solid in its soulless black digits . Her son was 07 years old , and they would never get another . <newline> <newline> *Got a little into some light SF , but the prompt calls out for it ! *\n","120":"*Bzzzt* <newline> <newline> Strange . Rick Banuelos was not a man to send or receive text messages , and wondered who the hell could be texting him at six in the morning while he was driving to work .

Still , it did n't trouble him too much until ... <newline> <newline> *Bzzt* <newline> *Bzzt* <newline> *Bzzt* <newline> <newline> The spacing of the vibrations on his phone made him certain nobody was calling . He was almost sure that he was receiving texts in rapid succession . He began to wonder if he was losing it , his work had been stressful lately ... .so much so that it had begun bleeding into his dreams . Just last night he had dreamed that his office opened up directly into a prison , resulting in him waking up drenched in sweat . Determined to not let this lack of sleep get to him , he refocused and noticed that his exit was coming up on his right in a mile . Rick checked his rear view mirror and was about to merge into the right lane when his phone started vibrating as if it was possessed . <newline> <newline> *bzzt* <newline> *bzzt* <newline> *bzzt* <newline> *bzzt* <newline> *bzzt* <newline> *bzzt* <newline> *bzzt* <newline> <newline> `` WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SHIT ?

It was n't even a full phone number ... just 6 digits . 373267 . 373267 . Keeping one eye on the road , Rick opened the new acquired conversation on his phone . <newline> <newline> At first glance , it appeared to be a gallery of his workplace . He noticed the familiar palm tree , and the water cooler , and the door to the prison ... ... .door to the prison ? Rick 's curiosity was piqued . <newline> <newline> Unfortunately for Rick , his eyes had strayed off the road for a moment too long . He noticed his exit on his right , but not the car in his blindspot . The screeching of metal on metal was the last thing he heard . <newline> <newline> His family and friends gathered around Rick 's bed . Whatever had survived the crash was scattered on the nightstand beside his bed . `` We do n't know when or even if he 'll wake up . I 'm sorry . '' The doctor had left them with those heavy words . <newline> <newline> One after one , the mourners began to file out of Rick 's room , until only his mother remained . She looked at her now comatose son and a silence filled the room . `` Can you hear me ? I just want to know if you can hear me ? '' She said it so quietly at first it was barely a whisper . She waited , almost numb with raw emotion ... then the floodgates opened . <newline> <newline> `` GODDAMNIT . '' `` GODDAMNIT GODDAMNIT GODDAMNIT . '' The woman began to openly weep . `` I just want to see you one last time . Not like this . Smiling . Happy . Whole again . '' <newline> <newline> The nightstand beside her vibrated . She picked up Rick 's phone and looked at his screen . `` One missed picture message.

Though my reason for enjoying that escape was different twenty years ago . <newline> <newline> Back then , whenever I stepped into the streets , I was lauded as a hero . As a friend . Toadstool 's knight in felt armor . <newline> <newline> But right and wrong changes . <newline> <newline> As the years have gone on , the kingdom has became more liberal . Goomba and Koopa activists groups appeared , and reexamined my deeds in the light of a ... `` new '' interpretation .

Who lives in a pineapple under the sea ? <newline> SpongeBob SquarePants ! <newline> <newline> I groan and open my sticky tired eyes . I can not help smiling . The song reminds me of my daughter in Portland Oregon . She loves Sponge Bob Square pants . I imagine her tiny body wrapped in pink unicorn embroidered sheets . Her silky red hair wild and free because it \u2019 s Saturday morning and she \u2019 s a child watching cartoons .

She \u2019 s a terror before coffee and just the thought of that wonderful pure even prepackaged beverage drives me from my sleep station . <newline> <newline> I wouldn \u2019 t say that I was energized . More driven . I flowed up to the cooking station . There are twelve of us on board , and I expected the \u201c kitchen \u201d to be cramped . But , I was alone . The crew hardly talks to each other , but the silences are respectful . Almost as though we didn \u2019 t need to speak .

I have to be on time . I actually got up early too , thankful he did n't transform into my alarm clock again . That 's the worst thing about it really . He 's 6 inches tall and has never posed any real threat , he 's just a super asshole about everything . There are days I pity him , doomed with the unflappable will to enslave all humanity but having no actual capacity to do so . What he can do though , is ruin my morning routine since I was 7 and make me perpetually late .

Maybe . Maybe not . Shaving done , time for the electric toothbrush , his old favorite . He knows dental health is a priority for me and I use it often . Another fateful reach and again , nothing . Now I 'm worried , he is never this quiet . Usually I foil his morning plans for world domination by now . <newline> <newline> <newline> I 've wasted too much time already . I need to pick up the pace , maybe he 's saving it for when I get home ? I hop in the shower and am only shampooing my hair when I hear my phone ring with my work 's ringtone .

'' Alex pointed to the television . `` Every single person on the planet . Everyone but me . '' <newline> <newline> It was all anyone was talking about . Every single channel . Speculation . Conspiracy theories . Mass hysteria . Tom had given up on caring just how the tattoos had appeared now that he knew what they meant . His mind had drifted to other , better thoughts . He could go sky diving . Climb mountains . No extreme activity was off limits anymore . The world was his oyster . <newline> <newline> Heart failure was n't such a bad way to go , all things considered . The only problem was not knowing when it would happen . That was the gift and the curse of an interior Glimpse .

Where you 'd be . Your age . Tom had deduced , well as much as one can deduce with a Google images search , that the valve depicted on his arm was somewhere between forty and sixty years old ( probably ) , but it did n't appear that there was a way to conclusively get any more specific than that . He could n't decide whether or not he was glad his time of death was a question mark . It was tough to focus on much of anything other than his teenage brother 's maniacal laughter . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm immortal ! I 'm gon na live forever ! Hahahahaha ! AAAHHHHHH- wait .

I packed away the cottages , and closed up the lodge and settled into the caretaker 's house , moving around in a bubble of unreality . At the beginning of February , I went up to work on the ski-lift motors and , impulsively , I threw the switch . I stood at the base for a few minutes , watching the chairs cycle against the empty sky , creaking in the cold , and , after a moment , walked over to the mount and parked myself on one of them . It began to climb , slow and steady , with a light breezes rocking it . I stared out over the mountain . <newline> <newline> I grew up here , you know . Dad 's owned this place since 1976 . I was born in Montreal but my first memories are the chalet in the 80s , toddling after my dad , weaving in and out of legs clad in furry boots . I can remember the slightly metallic smell of mittens drying on the radiator , mingling with Cookie 's stews and hot chocolates . I think I could ski before I could walk . When we decided to close up , I figured it was just temporary . This mountain would come back into fashion and everything would be back to normal . The Tremblant location was hardly going to take precedence ; this one was historic . <newline> <newline> But sitting there on the lift , staring out over the empty slopes , I looked into the future . The mothballed lodge would slide into disrepair . The cottages would become home to various mountain wildlife ; raccoons would nest in the mattresses . Ungroomed , the trails would grow over and disappear and the chair lift would idle , rusting , as the treetops reached up to meet it . I would rattle around here like the last pea in a can for a few years , clinging to my youth as my parents aged and retired on other mountains . Unable to arrest the decline , I 'd stop shaving my legs and cutting my hair and I 'd snowmobile into town for supplies every few weeks and hole up in the caretaker 's house , dreaming of better days until one day my brother 's kids retrieved me and put me in a home . I would live out - <newline> <newline> What was that ? <newline> <newline> I twisted around , trying to lay eyes on the movement in the corner of my eye . The chair bobbed precipitously ; if I was honest , this lift had needed repair for years . Suddenly I felt small and distant , alone on the mountain . My heartbeat quickened , but the chair settled again , and continued its clanking journey to the top . The wheelhouse came into view , its sloped shanty roof giving it an uneven , drunken appearance . What was I doing up here ? <newline> <newline> Movement again . <newline> <newline> I twisted slower this time , and the chair remained steady , except for an ominous groan at its hinge . Halfway up the mountain , a deer stepped out from between the pines . She was a handsome doe , tall and elegant , and she picked her way across a snowdrift as I watched , her head up , ears alert . <newline> <newline> My toes bumped ground and instinctively , I stood away from the lift and took two steps so it would n't bowl me over . I stood there staring at the deer for a long time , and after a few minutes , a massive stag emerged next to her . His antlers were enormous and he stood stock still , like he 'd been transformed into a tree and pinecones might start sprouting from him . The wind at the top was stronger and as I stood there , it began to sting my face and I realized I was crying . There were other resorts and other mountains , but this had been my home and I mourned its closure as if it had burned to the ground . Around me , a light flurry began to swirl as this grief gripped my chest and , without really meaning to , I cried out into the silence . It echoed down the mountain and the two deer bolted as if it had been a gunshot . Alone in the empty white void , I wept for the childhood behind me and the changed future ahead . The snow , uncaring , continued to fall .\n","127":"Someone posted a [ prompt ] ( https : \/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WritingPrompts\/comments\/3neiwf\/ttits_the_middle_ages_and_you_make_money_by\/cvnhfnm ) yesterday , and I felt compelled to write . <newline> <newline> Here 's what I 've got so far if anyone 's interested : <newline> <newline> *** [ TT ] It 's the Middle Ages and you make money by killing people . *** <newline> <newline> # Balthazar 's Masquerade Ball <newline> <newline> `` Cedric .

'' Candles flickered on torch mounts along the hallway at the passing of a calm wind , and a steady pace of water droplets dripped all around through the cracks in the stone ceiling . <newline> <newline> `` I did n't think you would show . '' <newline> <newline> `` Neither did I . '' <newline> <newline> The legion had n't called upon me for a few years -- ever since I had a falling out with one of their spies -- and I was quite surprised they managed to track me down for work . I never heard word from them unless they started something they did n't have the power to finish , or needed someone to fix a problem for political gains . <newline> <newline> `` Your *work* is valued , and unforgettable . We appreciate all you have done for the legion in the past . '' <newline> <newline> `` Cut to the point , Cedric . '' <newline> <newline> Cedric and I knew each other since the beginning of Balthazar 's reign . We served together for the High King 's Marshall and toured many years together , but we did n't always see eye to eye . At one point we were close as siblings , but now that time had passed , and the corruption of the legion has taken pursuit through anonymity , we no longer speak as kin -- only for business . <newline> <newline> `` Very well , Laina . The legion has high coin for trade of your service-*should you accept* , and again , thanks you for speaking with us on short notice . Our political prospect has veined a path to righteous ruling over the land . Although , things must go exactly as planned , or the opportunity will be lost . This is *the* most important move that the legion has ever made , and expects the outcome to be a flawless- '' Cedric coughed , and cleared his throat as a gesture . `` *-execution . * '' <newline> <newline> I pushed back the hood on my cloak which draped over my eyes , and showed my face to Cedric . `` What 's the catch ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It is inside Balthazar 's masquerade ball . '' <newline> <newline> *Loud noises , distractions and gluttony ? This should be easy coin* , I thought . * <newline> <newline> `` Like I said , what 's the catch ? '' <newline> <newline> A man masked as a traditional executioner walked around the corner , and his heavy stomps echoed throughout the tunnel system . I forced my attention to the man for a brief second , and watched as he struggled to lift a large , clumpy black bag across the hall . <newline> <newline> *Death and blood are smells one never forgets , I internalized* -- and listened to the wet slop , and slosh as the man dragged the bag from one room to another . <newline> <newline> `` Lord Balthazar . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . That is suicide . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , then . You 're in quite a predicament now , are n't you , Laina ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Who was in the bag ? '' <newline> <newline> Cedric grinned , and tapped his fingertips together in succession like a mad man . <newline> <newline> `` I am going to bet that was the person before me who declined the job , '' I said , then slipped my hood back over my head . <newline> <newline> `` Smart girl . '' <newline> <newline> A light illuminated through the doorway of the room to the left . This was the same room which the man had entered with the black bag . I heard a sizzle and singe , and the noise of a shovel scooping coal . The light grew brighter with each scoop and slide , and Cedric 's shadow had now cast over me . <newline> <newline> `` When ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Tonight . You have until sun up . If you do not succeed , we will find you , and- '' Cedric chuckled . `` -well , you get the point . '' <newline> <newline> `` How do you want it done ? '' <newline> <newline> `` It *must* look like an accident . The rest is up to you . '' <newline> <newline> `` Done . '' <newline> <newline> I gripped onto the rickety links of the wooden ladder with little support , and heard Cedric 's voice echo up the passage of the disguised stone-well . <newline> <newline> `` Time 's ticking , Laina . '' <newline> <newline> I pushed myself up and onto the ledge of the stone-well , and swung my legs over one at a time . A festive display of lights shone bright over the canopies of red oak trees in the direction of Balthazar 's city , and poured through the infinite crevices between their limbs , and leaves . I hopped down from the stone-well , and landed with a crisp , cool , crunch onto the wild grass beneath the soles of my knee-high boots . The night felt brisk . Blood rushed to my cheeks , and the tip of my nose went frigid . The temperature had fallen fast , and my time was running short . There was no time to think , plan , or contemplate my next move , so I sprinted into the red oak woods on an inadvertent path to the city . <newline> <newline> With nimbleness and finesse , I hurdled over toppled trees , and weaved around the massive trunks of the red oak 's in my way . Time was of extreme value , and I was losing value as each second passed . Crowd 's roared , and people cheered as I furthered deeper into the woods , and moisture from my lungs made puffs of white clouds with each panted exhale . I knew I was almost there -- the smell of filth from festivities traveled with the wind , and lingered in the wildlife . I slowed my pace to a casual jaunt , and then sauntered to the edge of the woods about twenty meters in . Darkness of the woods shrouded over me , and the foliage of the lowland bushes gave camouflage to my presence . I crept along the inner perimeter of the woods in stealth until I found a reasonable means of entrance -- and then I saw it . <newline> <newline> Right there . In front of me . Ten meters out . I held my breath , and bolted from cover into the clearing in front of the large city gates . I gave it everything I had . The bottom of my leather strapped boots slid on the gravel when I tried to stop , so I crouched for balance and braced myself for an unpleasant halt . My body slammed into the backside of the isolated , stone building , and I gasped for air . Out of breath , and winded from the long-hauled sprint , I seated myself on one of the wooden crates and took a minute to catch my breathe . Nothing but piles of rotten garbage , and a stockade of empty storage crates encompassed the backside of the shop . A perfect place to hide . <newline> <newline> *What the hell-* <newline> <newline> Liquid trickled , and splattered against the adjacent wall from where I hid . A man let out a groan of contentment , and sighed in satisfaction . I pulled out a compact mirror from a pouch on my vest , and slid off the wooden crate to inspect the noise . Zest from the city 's celebration roared , and nulled the subtle crunch of gravel in my step as I edged inches closer in silence . A twinkle , or flash from the mirror must have caught his attention when i peered around the corner , because he slurred a yelled in my direction- <newline> <newline> `` Oi ! '' <newline> <newline> *Damn . * <newline> <newline> `` Oi , you ! Do n't you move ! '' <newline> <newline> *Wasting time . I have to keep moving . * <newline> <newline> `` You lot 'ear me over there ? '' <newline> <newline> I put the compact away and revealed myself from the shadows . <newline> <newline> `` A woman ? ! '' The man swayed side to side , and hiccuped between words . `` I thought- '' *hiccup* `` -you were- '' *hiccup* `` -a threat ! '' <newline> <newline> He laughed , and pulled his trousers half way down his thighs . <newline> <newline> `` Can I help you ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` Why , yes . Yes , you can . '' <newline> <newline> The man hulked toward me and said , `` I fancy a good fuck . Come here you whore ! '' <newline> <newline> I readied my stance , and waited for him to come at me . He had one hand on his genitals , and the other opened like a claw at the height of my throat . The man charged at me , and in one quick motion I moved to the side , and used his own inertia to bring him to the ground . While he laid flat on his back , I grabbed a hand sized stone off the floor , and smashed it into the back of his skull a couple times before tossing it to the wayside . Girth on his arms were larger than my hands , but I still attempted to slide him behind the shop -- he was too heavy -- so I kicked over a mound of trash to pile over him . And when I did , metal clanked , bottles broke , and garbage rustled as the mountain of trash fell onto the man . His body was only half covered , and his legs , arms and hands stuck out . <newline> <newline> *Good enough , * I thought . <newline> <newline> I unsnapped the secret slit at the cuff of my sleeve , and pulled out a pouch made of pure armadillo hide . Inside the pouch was one needle with blue-ringed octopus venom from my travels to the eastern isles . I clasped the needle carefully , and hovered it beside the mans neck -- but hesitated . <newline> <newline> *Not worth it . I 'll save this for Balthazar . * <newline> <newline> I put away the needle , snapped the pouch inside my cuff , and ran toward the gates of the city . <newline>\n","128":"`` Get it out of my head ! '' The demon screamed <newline> <newline> `` This is so wrong ... I.. I think he likes it . He 's making me think of ... . kittens . '' <newline> <newline> `` Cant something be done ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey you started this . '' The demon obviously in charge stated as much as said . `` You possessed him . Remember ? '' <newline> <newline> `` But it was never like this before . He 's making me think of ... . nononono ... . Birthday party balloons ! ! '' The disfigured creature that at one point in time could have been human fell to his knees . `` You have to help me . He pleaded . '' <newline> <newline> `` You are the third guy thats complained with this problem this week . '' it looked down and snickered . <newline> <newline> `` Wait.. is it like with us ? If I know his name ? Can I use that to control it ? He just told me his name . Its Biff , his girlfriends name is ... . is Muffy . I should have paid more attention when he came to me . When he summoned me . He was just another silver spoon fed poor little rich boy . '' <newline> <newline> `` Eyiiiiiieeeeee . He 's making me think of ... .. eating rocky road ice cream . Oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus ... please help me ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Hey ... watch your language . I have to work here . No reason to bring his name into this . '' The lead demon adjusted his bifocles and sat down scratching his head . <newline> <newline> The `` possessed ' demon reached down and pulled a handful of maggots from a pulsing mass of nether-puss and stuffed them into his mouth , trying to get the taste or the memory of the taste of the earthly dessert from his mouth .\n","129":"Sky sat at their desk , tapping their fingers on the hard wood . They stared out the window , lacking inspiration and happiness . <newline> <newline> `` On days like today , there are only two things that will pick me up . '' They say to themselves , and sluggishly stand from their desk chair . They walked to the cabinets , and peeked inside of one . <newline> <newline> `` Dammit ! How the hell are we out of donuts ? '' They whispered to themselves . `` Chandler , did you eat my damn donuts again ! ? '' Sky yelled to their boyfriend , who had his setup down the hall . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry baby ! I can buy you more later ! I 'm in the middle of something right now though ! '' He called . <newline> <newline> `` Ugh . Fine . '' Sky huffed , and walked over to the refrigerator . They cursed under their breath and glanced down the hall . `` Goddammit Chandler ! You drank my fucking chocolate milk too ! What the hell am I going to do with you ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Shut up Sky , you love me ! I 'm really in the middle of something here cupcake ! Love you to bits ! '' He yelled . <newline> <newline> `` Whatever asshole . I 'll go get my own damn donuts . '' They grumbled , and grabbed the key off the counter . <newline> <newline> `` I love you~ '' Chandler yelled . <newline> <newline> `` I love you too . You bastard . '' They laughed and walked out . <newline> <newline> Sky looked around the storage room . Not a single box of donuts to be found . And no chocolate milk in the refrigerator . `` Damn , I thought place got restocked every night . '' They mumbled . <newline> <newline> They walked out of the storage room and glanced through the hallways . This institution is n't the biggest , or the most state-of-the-art , but it 's home to its fifteen residents . <newline> <newline> Sky could hear someone splashing down at the pool room . Probably Lyra , she probably snatched the donuts too , Sky would have to talk with her about that . They could smell Ashley cooking in the kitchen , and hear Matthew and Rebecca flirting with each other . They walked to the library , hoping to find someone to talk to there . Of course , Dean was on his laptop , probably playing some video game , AJ and Keith were reading in the corner , and Samantha was writing her short stories at her quaint little desk in the center of the room . Joseph and Mary were probably on the second floor of the institution , trying on outfits or rehearsing songs or whatever ever they did when they were n't making out . Then finally the pounding coming from the gymnasium told them that Sam , Skylar , and Martin were playing basketball . <newline> <newline> Life was n't exactly easy in the institution , no contact with the outside world , and no way to truly trust others . We were all random people , ages 20 through 25 , who were stuck together in this place . We can only truly rely on ourselves to get out , and we all want to get out , but until then we bide our time and occupy ourselves . The only known way out is truly terrible though , so I hope no one plans to leave for a while . <newline> <newline> After all , none of us could ever *really* murder someone else here and get away with it .\n","130":"I came from college , it 's a rainy day , and the day was awful , I just want to arrive to my house , prepare a coffee and watch some TV . <newline> <newline> When I arrive , I see a letter on my mailbox . No sender . No stamps . Just destination : my address and my name . <newline> <newline> I prepare my coffee and open the letter , and it just says `` DO NOT ANSWER THAT PHONE '' in big letters , with a kinda professional font . <newline> <newline> I was really pissed , because it looked so real , not like a joke , and exactly at that moment , my home phone starts ringing . Yes , I was waiting for a couple of calls but I did n't expected this letter . <newline> <newline> The phone stopped ringing , and inmediately , my smartphone starts ringing with the number +83 728 373 1134 and I decided not to answer . Inmediately I look for the number on internet , but the +83 code does n't exist . <newline> <newline> With the coffee and this strange calls I could n't sleep this night , also adding some paranoia to the formula . <newline> <newline> After the sun rises , I 'm still on my bed , trying to guess what the hell is happening . And I decided to go to the police , and it was the same as I would talk with the wall , they only said it was a joke . I also said about this problem to a friend and he seemed to pay attention to it , but I think he just ignored me . <newline> <newline> I go to my house , took all my money and some clothes , turn off my smartphone , lock my house and go to a extended stay hotel . I go to the front desk and said that I did n't want to receive calls . <newline> <newline> I go to my room , with a relief sensation , I lay on the bed and watch some TV , and after a couple of hours , I finally could sleep . <newline> <newline> I wake up at the morning with a sound , the sound of the phone ringing . I was scared and mad at the same time . I went to the front desk because I did n't want to use the phone and yelled at the recepcionst about why he is transfering me calls , and he answers that no one had called since I arrived , not even to the other rooms . I apologize and my paranoia returns , while I go to the room . <newline> <newline> I sit on the bed thinking what happened now , and the phone rings again , but now I decided to answer <newline> <newline> > Hello ? <newline> <newline> > *I told you that you should n't answer the phone* <newline> <newline> And then , a lot of guys break into the room , they hold me and one of them put a damp cloth on my nose and mouth , I blacked out almost inmediately . <newline> <newline> I wake up , but I ca n't move , I ca n't talk , just barely open one of my eyes , I feel drunk , and I see a light , then a doctor and two nurses , and they are talking <newline> <newline> > DUI ? <newline> <newline> > DUI <newline> <newline> > Well , finally we have a donor <newline> <newline> And then I thought , I do n't drive , I do n't like alcohol , even I 'm not a donor , What the hell is happening ? <newline> <newline> And now I see the doctor use the scalpel on my stomach and I blacked out ... forever .\n","131":"The horse struggled up the last dune , with the soft sand giving way under the weight of each hoof . The journey had taken them over countless ridges just like this one , but the last is always the hardest . The horse shook its mane and snorted in protest , so Melizan rubbed her neck for encouragement . \u201c Almost there , girl. \u201d <newline> <newline> From his pocket , he withdrew the withered square of parchment that he \u2019 d been following for weeks now . It seemed that the closer they got to the destination , the more often he checked it . On the very outskirts on the map , the trading ports along the cost were marked with dots . From the city of Sinsinsa where they \u2019 d departed , the journey was estimated to be more than 300 miles through barren desert . But one really couldn \u2019 t be sure ; the very idea of the Source was laughable to some , and no more than mythical to most . Melizan himself hadn \u2019 t believed the map at first until the Bone Oracle confirmed its authenticity . Realizing that he had no actual reason to check it , he put the map away again . <newline> <newline> At the top of the ridge , a surge of excitement lanced through Melizan \u2019 s entire body and even the horse seemed to feel it . A crater spread out in a perfect circle below them , at least a dozen miles wide . In the very center , the stone pillar reached toward the sky surrounded by an oasis of water , green grass , and violet wildflowers . Melizan blinked , not quite trusting his eyes anymore . Even the heavens themselves seemed to be leading Melizan toward it ; the whole oasis was bathed in a bright shaft of sunlight . The rays sparkled off the calm surface of the water at the very center . <newline> <newline> Probably more motivated by the sight of fresh water than the awe-inspiring pillar , the horse charged down the side of the dune at breakneck pace . Upon reaching the edge of the pond , she stooped down to drink without even letting Melizan dismount first . It had been an arduous journey across the desert , and they \u2019 d reached the oasis just in time : the last of the water skins was down to its final drops . The sounds of the waterfall pouring from the center of the pillar made Melizan \u2019 s throat even more parched . He could n't really blame her . <newline> <newline> Melizan waited with baited breath as his horse lapped at the water . There were many rumors about what the water of the Source would do . Some said that it was pure poison that would kill a man within minutes ; one last attempt by the Gods to correct their greatest folly : mankind . But men had foiled the Gods using forgotten magics to cut off the Source from the rivers of the world , hence the desolate desert for hundreds of miles around . The horse seemed to be doing fine , so Melizan guessed that that probably wasn \u2019 t the case . Hope began to grow in the back of his mind : that the waters of the Source were so pure that they still contained the very *essence* of life itself . Maybe drinking from the pond actually *could* grant immortality . What other reason would an old man have for trekking halfway across the continent just for a drink ? <newline> <newline> \u201c Here \u2019 s to you , girl , \u201d Melizan told the horse , holding up his tin cup in a toast . The horse was too busy drinking to have any reaction . Melizan pressed the rim of the cup to his lips and immediately noticed how *cold* the water was ; even in the far North the water never seemed so crisp . He let the water fill his parched cheeks , then swallowed it all in one gulp . *This must be what heaven tastes like , * he told himself . He reached forward to plunge his cup into the water again . But as he pulled it out , he noticed a set of eyes staring back at him from under the rippling surface <newline> <newline> The eye sockets of the skull were half-filled with mud and silt , but the bleached-white bones were unmistakable . Melizan dropped the cup in horror and pulled the skull from the muck . Beneath it , he could see the remains of a hand and what looked like a ribcage . <newline> <newline> He was so fixated on the skull , wondering what its story was , that he did n't even notice his horse wade into the pond , still drinking . The splashing sound pulled Melizan from his thoughts to find his horse chest-deep in the water . He called out to her , trying to coax the horse back to the shore , but she just headed deeper and deeper , barely keeping her nose above the surface . The pond hadn \u2019 t seemed that deep from a distance , but the horse finally ducked underwater completely and disappeared . <newline> <newline> Something inside of Melizan urged him to take a dip in the pond too . Part of his mind knew it was a bad idea , but that part seemed very far away now . The water had been so cool and refreshing , and the long trip through the desert had been so stiflingly hot . The surface was calm , despite the fact that his horse still hadn \u2019 t surfaced . *Shouldn \u2019 t she be struggling for air by now ? * the far-away portion of his mind asked . The thought was quickly forgotten as he took another step forward . The water felt so good on his skin , refreshing but not chilling . <newline> <newline> He waded deeper and deeper into the pond , paying no attention to the rigid white shapes poking at his feet from under a layer of mud . The skull that he \u2019 d pulled from the water remained on the bank , watching him submerge himself all the way up to his neck . The last thing he heard before plunging his head under the surface was the soft babbling of the water falling from the center of the Source .\n","132":"`` not significantly impact your timeline '' Where 's the fun in that ? Nevertheless , I 'll give it a whack . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- <newline> <newline> The smoke rose from the campfire of the barbarians , mingling with the scent burning houses and bodies . The smoke rose up to the highest walls in Christendom , obscuring the visions of the guards atop the spires . Two sat on boxes that they had lugged up there , drinking from skins of wine . They knew that they could not defend the city from this , and were waiting out the inevitable . <newline> <newline> In the camp of the barbarians , tension as two barbarian kings discussed the siege , how long they would have to camp outside the walls , and how long they could stay before supplies ran out . <newline> <newline> In all history books , the answer to their question was ten years . Ten years before the gates of Rome were opened and the Goths sacked the city . <newline> <newline> Then there was a whoosh , and one of the barbarians , Alaric , fell down . A hole in his head , he lay dead on the ground . The other barbarian , Ataulf , leaned in to inspect his brother-in-law . Another whoosh , and he too was dead . <newline> <newline> Over the next few days , panic swept the Gothic camp . Leaderless , the Goths slowly dispersed as anyone foolish enough to take up the Gothic reins died . <newline> <newline> Within the month , the siege was over . Rome had beaten back the Goths . Pope Innocent christened it a miracle . <newline> <newline> On the day that those first two , Alaric and Ataulf , died miraculous deaths , something was seen on the walls . In a brief time when the smoke had cleared , two half-drunk sentries spotted a figure down the wall which some remember as the Guardian Angel of Rome . He was in the process of rising up from a prayerful crouch , and in his hand he held a long spear with no spear-head , which he pointed at the Gothic camp . Then , just as the sentries had made out his image , he vanished in a flash of light .\n","133":"`` Your honor , I move to strike the following six jurors for cause . They all have a clear , demonstrated history with my client which will unduly influence their decisions in this procee.. '' said the man in a navy blue suit and a red tie . But , he could not get it all out before another man jumped to his feet . <newline> <newline> `` Your honor , this is death court ; It 's not some high falootin ' , glass tower , federal prosecution in New York City . If you strike those jurors , in the interest of fairness , you 'll have to strike the other six , who have a demonstrable bias in favor of the defendant . '' said another man who sat across a long marble aisle at a very large , glossy table . He wore a blue seersucker suit that barely fit over his humorously round gut . He slid his thumbs up his suspenders and presented a smug expression . <newline> <newline> The sound of a gavel interrupted the age old ritual that the two were playing out . `` You both know , as well as I do , how this objection ends . '' The voice emanated from a ball of light which was surrounded by intensely white and fluffy clouds . These clouds floated above a huge wooden bench which held a nameplate : `` The Honorable I AM . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , your honor , but I have to maintain my client 's rights , on the record , you know for appeal . '' said the man in navy . <newline> <newline> `` Appeal ? '' said the cloudy voice . <newline> <newline> There was a long , drawn out pause . <newline> <newline> `` Fine , duly noted . '' said the voice . `` Please begin counselor . '' <newline> <newline> The man in the seer sucker began speaking while the man in blue took a seat . He leaned over , placing a hand on the shoulder of a figure who say next to him . The figure was wide-eyed and agape . Gerry had not planned on dying today . <newline> <newline> `` Is ... is . '' Gerry whispered . `` Is that who I think it is ? '' he motioned with his head towards the judges bench and the blinding light which hovered over it . The light pulsated and shifted about as the seer suckered man paced to and fro in front of the court . <newline> <newline> The man in navy pursed his lips and nodded . `` Kinda . it 's hard to explain , really . Honestly , that 's the least of your concerns . '' the lawyer adjusted himself in his seat and pointed to the bailiff . `` That 's who you need to be concerned with . '' he said with nonchalance . <newline> <newline> Gerry followed the gesture and screamed . Standing , tentacles , arms , and legs akimbo was a mass of darkness whose presence could only be felt in the bit of Gerry 's stomach . The sound of screeching infants and tearing metal filled his ears , and his mind 's eye saw a leering face with a thickly muscled tongue which whipped about in random directions . <newline> <newline> A loud banging brought Gerry back to his senses . Looking up , he stared , wide-eyed at the banging gavel and the ball of light . `` I 'll have no disturbances in my courtroom , Mr. Johnson . Please keep your client under control . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , your honor . '' <newline>\n","134":"He walked towards the large glass window . He was so lonely ever since his wife left him . That day , he had figured a walk throughout town might brighten his spirits ; perhaps today he might find a match . The implant on his neck was cool as it had not been used for over a decade . <newline> <newline> He had entered the aquarium on a whim . He was surprised to find it nearly empty . The people must have gone home for the week as it was nearly Thanksgiving . It was only him and the lone beluga whale ; trapped in an endless cycle of loneliness . <newline> <newline> *You have one new match* <newline> <newline> He was shocked . There must be someone nearby . He scanned the room but it was empty . Perhaps someone had walked by into another room , too embarrassed to come face to face with their match . He scoured the adjacent rooms with no such luck , and even ran throughout the entire aquarium . The man was confused : there had to have been someone nearby . <newline> <newline> He returned to the room he was in when he had gotten his match . There was no one there . The implant was now warm . <newline> <newline> *You have one new match . Would you like to say hi ? * <newline> <newline> There was no one there . Perhaps his implant had broken . <newline> <newline> `` Tinder , say hi .

Once , the schoolyard had been asphalt , so those caught in the spray squeal as their exos blind them behind a shield . <newline> <newline> Kendall gives chase , shouting my name , commanding proximity . I deny his request and increase base velocity . Overhead , several cargo freighters pile by , their under-racks , normally used to quickly relocate train cars , retrofitted for the Triplicate Legion . These were empty , but even Kendall slowed and looked up to see if any soldiers were aboard . <newline> <newline> Disappointment sifted aside , I dive and weave through a gaggle of lower-thirds . Those whose exos have pulse jumpers activate them and shoot their wards from my line ; those who do n't simply freeze . When there is nowhere to weave , I thank the Triplicate that my father holds rank enough to afford the same pulse jumpers and leap fifteen feet into the air , whirling to the cheers of my classmates , and then spring ahead . <newline> <newline> If my father did n't hold rank , would I be chased at all ? <newline> <newline> `` No fair ! '' screams Kendall , falling away . <newline> <newline> I 'm breathing heavily , but slow to a stop . As I inhale , several holes open in the front of my exo , letting even more air in ; three tracheas are better than one . Moments later , my blood is oxygenated , my legs are ready for another round . <newline> <newline> On the outside , the exos do n't appear any different . Simple , white plates covering the chest , like shoulder blades on the front . Similar allocations on the hips , and the sides of the thighs and triceps . Then , soles of the feet , and a horseshoe band from the brain stem around to the temples . <newline> <newline> On the inside , however , opulence affected performance . The more money one had , the deeper the exo probed . My lungs , heart , and stomach were coated in a material that would harden instantly if struck by ballistics . Same with my skull . <newline> <newline> Such as it was , Kendall had no such applications on his exo . His father worked as a loadsman , so the only real enhancements he had were in his lifting strength . He 'd someday take over the family business . <newline> <newline> `` Gotcha ! '' shouted Wynn , grappling my arms . Kendall , huffing , started to run over , a grin crossed with a scowl on his face . `` I got you , you little termite ! '' <newline> <newline> But no son of a soldier was ever so easily captured . I pulsed from the left leg , then from the right . I was smaller , but the power of the air pumped from my exo put Wynn off-kilter on the first pump , and laid him low on the second . I had been strictly , and in no uncertain terms , told to *not* do what I was about to , but here I was , and there they were . <newline> <newline> Kendall was fifteen yards out . I charged . As the soles of my feet reached perpendicular to my body , further airbursts were emitted . The first few times I did this , when I was only five , my brain felt funny . Now , I felt the rush . Kendall reared his fist back for the sort of punch that would crack ribs ; as he delivered , my thigh pulsed out reflexively , my head went down and under the potential blow , and I used the same emphasis in my arm that he did , slamming him with a palm-out shot to his exo that sent him reeling to his bottom . <newline> <newline> I did n't finish a step toward him before I felt a hand on my shoulder and a rush of air . Teacher was here . <newline> <newline> I was in deep trouble .\n","136":"In the early years it was always easy , choosing what to pick . If I wanted to be more popular , I could wish to be prettier , to have fuller hair , or thinner hips . But by 8th grade that was what most of my classmates picked too and we all basically looked like goddamn models anyway . <newline> <newline> Status started to rely on other things , things like charisma and charm . Luckily though by that time I had stopped giving a shit whether I was popular or not and had started to become interested in science . <newline> <newline> So when the form came on my 14th birthday from the government , informing me that I was able to choose a new feature I immediately knew I wanted to be smarter so I could more easily understand all those complicated theories in my latest science text about black holes . <newline> <newline> My mother congratulated me on my first mature choice . She told me that that was how it always used to be and that the program first started as a way to make humans more evolved but had recently degenerated into a modern day never ending beauty contest . <newline> <newline> My best friend Sarah disagreed wholeheartedly . Her boyfriend Eric liked extreme sports and 'extreme ' friends . So somewhat shy Sarah had decided she was going to ask to be more daring so that they could have more in common . <newline> <newline> I thought it was a dumb choice from the beginning because why in the hell would you waste a choice on something as shallow as that , but who cares , I had thought . <newline> <newline> Sarah was her own person and could pick whatever she wanted . We grew apart soon after that as I had with many friends before . Not because of Sarah though , not because she ditched me for her boyfriend and not because she suddenly spent all of her time sky diving . <newline> <newline> It was because the year after that she had asked for a better sense of humor and our little inside jokes were no longer were funny , they paled in comparison to the witty banter that Sarah could easily start up with all the other people that had asked for similar comedic genius . <newline> <newline> I could have picked to be funny too but at that point I had come to wonder what was the point ? Was I picking things because that was what I wanted or just to fit in ? I asked to be more logical the next year and it was then that I started noticing the differences , I could n't put my finger on it exactly . <newline> <newline> I heard similar variations of the same joke 4 times in one month the next year . I usually never would have noticed but wishing to be more observant had its perks I guess . After a while you can find the pattern , with a little focus I can tell what personality trait someone chose and what year they picked it . They change the programs you know . So someone who chose to be witty in one year answers a little different than someone who wishes for the same thing the next . But I can still tell . <newline> <newline> It makes it somewhat awkward when I go out with others I can almost feel the beats of the conversation as they flow in that programmed manner . I can guess when someone will pause to make the next thing they say have greater effect . Its supposed to be impressive but to me it just seems hollow . <newline> <newline> When I first figured it out I thought of making experiments and showing the world my findings , that I could uncover this great conspiracy . Imagine my surprise when I got to college only to find out that everyone knew . Ok , well that is an exaggeration , not everyone knew specifically that asking for a better personality would make you a copy of a copy . <newline> <newline> What I mean is no one really cared . If you did n't ask for the random mix of traits that I did , observant , analytical , enhanced memory or little things like pattern recognition , you would never notice . So no one else can tell that Sarah raises her voice the exact same amount of decibels at the end of her punchline as everyone else that chose a better sense of humor in the year 3010 . <newline> <newline> Maybe I 'm just being overly critical but it 's driving me insane .\n","137":"`` You know I hate this restaurant , why do we always come here ? God I fucking hate you Steve , '' Veronica said unenthusiastically as she moved her onion ring around in small bowl of the honey mustard . <newline> <newline> `` You fucking hate me ? '' Steve began yawning , `` If hate was funny accents and baguette 's I 'd be France . '' He had used this line too much . It had no impact . <newline> <newline> Steve bit into his onion ring , and the entire translucent flaccid onion decided followed into his mouth with a slurp . He was left awkwardly holding an empty shell of fried breadcrumbs . <newline> <newline> `` You 've already had seven onion rings , '' Veronica announced , with a sigh , twisting the gold ring around her finger `` That 's more than half the order . You ca n't have another . I do n't know why we even bother to split appetizers when you eat the whole thing . '' <newline> <newline> `` Maybe you should just eat faster bitch , '' Steve 's tone sounded rehearsed . <newline> <newline> Veronica remembered when she and Steve had just met . Steve had always been her type . Loudly announcing his entry to rooms , using the word guesstimate , he even legitimately thought that Michael Bay was a skilled directer . Seriously , what kind of half-brained idiot could even say he was good , let alone a visionary . <newline> <newline> The rivalry had started like any other . Stealing each other 's newspapers , spitting in each other 's food , passive aggressively implying things to their neighbors about the other 's sexual habits . One time he threw his grandmother 's vase at her head . A family heirloom , shattered , just because he could n't stand to be around her . Now that was real hatred , but things might have went to fast . <newline> <newline> Before she even knew it they were nemeses , having children to have virulent custody battles over and poising each other 's food . What had happened to her career ? She just got too caught up in all the stupid bullshit that came with being nemeses . This was comfortable , but was n't there more to life than comfort ? That 's what kept her mom in that borderline civil hatred for all those years . Near the end they even laughed at each other 's jokes ! That could n't happen to her right ? She had n't become her mother , had she ? <newline> <newline> `` So how 's that art degree working out , '' Steve asked stifling another yawn , `` Still ca n't find a job drawing pictures ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh that 's just like you- '' Veronica began trying to rekindle the flame of their hatred , but Steve had stopped listening . He was checking his phone . He had one unread message . It was his secretary . It read : Can u talk ? <newline> <newline> `` -you small dicked fucking piece of shit ! You think this is easy for me ? Huh ? ! '' Veronica was now screaming , but the restaurant hardly seemed to notice . Everyone could tell her heart was n't into it . She was just doing this to make things at least seem normal . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , I got ta take a phone call , wait a second , '' Steve said standing up from the table , almost forgetting to add an insult before half-heartedly tacking on , `` Um bitch . '' <newline> <newline> Steve never intended to start hating his secretary , it just kind of happened . She was just so young and new , before he knew it , he started cussing her out . She was a Tea-Party conservative ! Can you believe it ? Who the fuck is that stupid ? I mean sure , Veronica was voted for Reagan , twice , and not to put down all the horrible things he did , but this was a new century . Reagan was practically lovable in the face of these new half crazy half brain dead conservatives . <newline> <newline> `` I just wanted to tell you that I shredded the Hopkins account , '' his secretary whispered , `` that 's what you get for this year 's Christmas bonus . '' <newline> <newline> `` You ca n't call me like this , '' Steve grumble trying to hide his rage , `` You know I 'm with my Nemesis ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I 've been a naughty girl then , '' His secretary mockingly cooed back , `` I hope no one steals my lunch from the refrigerator tomorrow . '' <newline> <newline> Veronica had seen the signs . The fact that he was n't even trying to belittle her when he came home at night , stinking of whiskey with some other girl 's loogie on his shirt . He had been trying belittle her every night since they met ! She was n't dumb . She decided to put him to the test , if he really hated her , she 'd know after tonight . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , '' Steve said , pulling out his chair , `` What were you saying about my small dick ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh never mind about that , '' Veronica said , holding back tears . She could see the vein bulging in his forehead . She was the only person in the world who could make that vein bulge like that years ago . <newline> <newline> `` Listen , I heard a joke the other day , and I thought even an idiot like you could maybe understand that '' She said putting on a fake scowl , `` So this guy walks into a bar with a dog . Bartender says 'Hey buddy , no dogs allowed . ' Guy tells him , 'No you do n't understand this is n't any usual dog , it 's a talking dog . ' Bartender looks at him like he 's crazy , but then he has an idea . 'Okay , if this dog can talk , ' bartender says , 'you and him can stay , but if he ca n't I 'm throwing you and the mongrel out the window , but your wallet 's staying here , understand . ' 'Of course ' the guy says , and he turns to his dog . 'What 's on top of a house ? ' Guy asks . 'Roof ' The dog answers . 'What 's on top of your mouth ? ' 'Roof , ' the dog says again . 'Who 's the best baseball player who ever lived ? ' 'Roof ' and before the dog could even close his mouth the bartender picked them both up and threw them out of the bar . '' <newline> <newline> `` The dog then turns to his master and says 'Think I should of said DiMaggio ? ' '' <newline> <newline> `` Heh that 's pretty funny , '' Steve admitted between laughs . <newline> <newline> Veronica could n't help but cry .\n","138":"> 2nd Battalion , 2nd Marines ; quantity force : 2 <newline> <newline> It was only the Squad 's Automatic Rifleman and the Designated Marksman that were left . They were huddled up in the rocks , and the enemy was combing everything over . Not a hair to be seen , except for that of the fallen Timberwolves . The Automatic Rifleman fixed the boonie hat - like the Designated Marksmans , though he had a shemagh over his mouth - before looking around for a few seconds . Nobody had passed . <newline> <newline> Dust blew over the sand , setting a better scene for the Designated Marksman . He looked over , placing a hand in the air . It closed into a fist - calling for attention from the Automatic Rifleman . Ranks did n't discern them , they were both Lance Corporals . <newline> <newline> The Marksman lifted his SAM-R slightly in one hand . He made a notion to set a strike - *or suppressing fire* - on the spread out force of forty that had taken down their friends . <newline> <newline> Fire spread amongst the air as the M240B 's barrel began releasing howling rounds . Soon after , loud , although slow shots from the SAM-R began popping out . Recreating the punching outwards and gripping inwards signal , he then pointed towards a fragmentation grenade on his own vest . He had to return his focus , quickly , firing a few rounds . <newline> <newline> Men were dropped left and right , were they the Timberwolves who had fallen for these two Marines , now living to give it all against forty armed men . The SAM-R eventually unloaded , so by instinct the Lance Corporal withdrew his M9 , firing a few rounds . Not very many hit , one egging a man in the arm . <newline> <newline> It was n't going to be much , but the force that was trying to respond had only just then seen at least one of them - the Rifleman , who was reloading . The belt was n't fitting right . The Designated Marksman pierced the air with one more round from the 9mm , and then threw it towards his ally and bashed his rifle to unjam a round . <newline> <newline> Each 5.56mm round that expelled itself from the SAM-R 's chamber , was dwindling their resources . The Marksman rose slowly , entering a standing posture as he fired . <newline> <newline> The enemy force dwindled , next , to about ten men . However , once this milestone was achieved , seven rounds ripped into the Automatic Rifleman . Within this contact , it went up from the chest until , yes , he had fell . <newline> <newline> Left alone , the Designated Marksman pegged out four more rounds and then had to withdraw his knife . A round clipped his shin , and he drew the blade back and went into the neck of one of the standing hostile infantry . Once it was removed , he used them for stability , throwing the blade . <newline> <newline> Two more rounds pressed into his chest , leaving another force of two , amongst many more fallen bodies - however no more Timberwolves to run this troop down . The surviving Designated Marksman and Automatic Rifleman had failed , making way to a Afghan Rifleman duo . <newline> <newline> *They had the drop , but they failed . *\n","139":"<newline> `` Hmmmm '' ... .started moving my mouth like i was eating something , licking my lips only to realize my mouth was dry.Scraped the last drop of Jack that was hidden in my mouth . `` Blaaah '' I stopped walking . `` Here it comes '' Was wondering why have n't I thrown up yet `` Buuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh `` . But instead it was a velociraptor burp only . `` heheh '' i was so proud.Still standing in the same spot I heard laughter and the next thing i know some people from across the street are calling me . <newline> <newline> `` Heeeey brother , come join us '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm coming , I 'm coming , I 'm here , I am near '' <newline> <newline> They started laughing again like a pack of wild hyenas.As i was crossing the street i saw about 6,7,8 about 10 guys sitting on a couple of stairs . <newline> <newline> `` What 's up my man '' <newline> <newline> `` Wazaaaaaaaaaa '' <newline> <newline> All of them replied momentarily `` Wazaaaaaaaa '' while laughing and jumping around me as i was coming close to them.I sat in the middle of them all on the stairs . <newline> <newline> `` How are you this evening gentleman ?

'' <newline> <newline> `` You ai n't robbing me now , there is nothing left '' With a grin on my face . <newline> <newline> The whole bunch of them went hysterical jumping and screaming all around while some of them were hanging on the shoulders of the guy with the money . <newline> <newline> Another guy asked `` How come you have that nice suit on and no money '' <newline> <newline> `` Last time i wore this suit was 3 years ago on my high school graduation.And tonight because i went to propose to my girlfriend '' <newline> <newline> `` yeaaa ? Where is she now then ?

Except it was n't fun , it was bullshit . If you 've ever been to Crater Lake , or any lake for that matter , you would know that lakes are incredibly boring . I 'm sure there are some things you can do for fun on a lake , like intertubing or jetskiing ; however our outings mostly revolved around `` soaking up the sun '' , whatever that means . <newline> <newline> One summer though , was certainly more interesting than the others . This summer was between my eight and ninth grade year , so as you could imagine , I was spanking the monkey A LOT that summer . The story begins on our drive up from the small town of Talent , Oregon , which was a cool 7 hours away from the lake . This drive mostly consisted of me and my siblings fighting and my mom playing Elton John CDs nobody liked . <newline> <newline> Amidst the chaos that is a packed minivan , I managed to take a subtle glance at the gas meter , and realized it was almost empty , only about 4 hours into the drive . I decided to alert the driver , my father , <newline> <newline> `` Um , Dad , we 're running out of gas '' <newline> <newline> My Dad turned around and gave me the evil eye glance , this kind of confused me because I was n't entirely sure what triggered him . <newline> <newline> `` Aright , Steve , why do n't you pay for this next fillup , HUH TOUGH GUY ? We 'll make it , I 'll just put it in Neutral when we are going downhill . '' <newline> <newline> I said nothing but I was really thinking , `` Holy shit dad that 's the dumbest fucking idea I 've ever heard . '' Sure enough we pull into a trashy gas station one hour later because the engine was starting to cough like my dog does before it throws up . <newline> <newline> As I mentioned earlier , this was a particularly `` high hormone '' time in my life , so my much ill trained 14 year old mind somehow convinced itself it would be good idea to go relieve some stress in the bathroom . I walked into the restroom and , holy shit , the smell . I seriously had no idea if I could even do the deed with such a smell , but eventually I resolved that I would just hold my breath and finish off before I needed to gasp for air . <newline> <newline> Unfortunately , this was possible . <newline> <newline> So I walk into the stall and pull down my pants , but before I can even get started , I glance up at the massive amounts of graffiti on the wall , mostly phone numbers written such as `` call xxx-xxxx for a good time ! ! ! '' I initially shrugged it off and started my business . <newline> <newline> Whilst I proceeded I decided to look up one last time , and look at the graffiti on the wall , because well , It was the better option to gaze at . That 's when I saw it . A bit lower than where my eyes met the wall , was inscribed a phone number that seemed all too familiar . In fact , it was my phone number . <newline> <newline> `` Holy Shit ! '' I exclaimed , and I stopped my business right at that moment . A brigade of questions came into my mind . Was this one of my friends ? Perhaps a family member from years past ? I do n't think we had ever stopped at this gas station before . <newline> <newline> I began to panic , and at that moment I gasped for air after not being able to hold my breath any longer . I began to hyperventilate , no doubt breathing in massive amounts of shit particles . <newline> <newline> Then I became less concerned with discovering how the number had appeared there and more so with how to erase it , and so I frantically scrubbed it with my finger , with no success . I paused for a second and thought of how to solve this problem , how could I erase the number ? At this moment I came up with what I will forever remember as the most paradoxical solution to a problem I have ever conceived . <newline> <newline> The solution was simultaneously the greatest and worst idea I 've ever had . <newline> <newline> In a moment of desperation , I dipped my finger into the not-so-clean gas station toilet bowl , and used the wet finger to frantically scrub the number off the wall . After finishing my quest , I felt relieved . I pulled up my pants , left the stall , and began my journey back to the car . <newline> <newline> However as I left one last thing caught my eye . As I walked out I glanced briefly at the sink , a tool made specifically for dispensing sanitary water onto the hands . <newline> <newline> `` Fuck . '' I uttered under my breath .\n","142":"Explosions shook the building he was hiding in , his back to the wall , crouched down into a ball with his rifle at his side . He had been through the sims , done all the training , gotten the injections , but he still did n't feel ready .

He had no idea where the rest of his squad was now , but he was n't too concerned about that . <newline> <newline> A shell impacted the building he was inside of , dust and debris falling around him .

She held the record out between them . <newline> <newline> \u201c The Jedi liked to believe they were saviors . But how much pain and suffering did the general public endure under their watchful eye ? They believe in self-restraint and bottling up your feelings . Life was not meant to be bottled. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c You believe in the ways of the Sith then ? \u201d <newline> <newline> Chancellor Tyvest chuckled . A glass of blue liquid floated to the chancellor \u2019 s mouth . It tilted , letting a sip slide past his lips . The glass landed on the table before the chancellor continued . \u201c My dear , I detest the word as much as you do . The Sith were wrong as well . Reckless and with no regard to their fellow beings , especially if they differed in opinion . That \u2019 s no way to move life forward . But they did have a knack for channeling their power . They saw no reason to hold back potential . Now that \u2019 s how you advance an agenda. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I don \u2019 t follow , sir . You are a practitioner of the Force . Surely you \u2019 ve chosen a side ? \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Ah , I have . I chose both . You see , both the Light and the Dark side have their merits . But being fully engrossed in one incorrectly portrays the Force . You must have balance. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c If I remember my studies , many have tried and failed that approach. \u201d <newline> <newline> Chancellor Tyvest nodded . \u201c It is a constant battle . I must be conscious of my thoughts , actions , and emotions at all times , else suffer from slipping too far down one path. \u201d <newline> <newline> Numbra glanced at her wrist . \u201c Time for one more question , Chancellor Tyvest . Your recent approval of the Jabrolin harvest\u2014 \u201d <newline> <newline> The chancellor waved his hand . \u201c You want to ask me about the training regimen at the House of Force. \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c Tell me about the training regimen at the House of Force. \u201d <newline> <newline> Chancellor Tyvest smiled . \u201c We \u2019 ll have our first class of younglings starting soon . They \u2019 ll go through Dark side teachings at the start . The Dark side brings out the animal-like instincts seen during puberty , so we can accelerate that process . Then they \u2019 ll move onto the Light side lessons . Those are better when the students have begun maturing , but still think themselves better than the average citizen . From there , we \u2019 ll blend the two schools of thought . Then , we \u2019 ll send them out to each system to rule as I have .

His friends had said there was a skeleton in here with a sword laid next to it . His friends were cowards and ran away when they saw the corpse . Jonathan was no coward , and his friends were probably liars . He kept search the cave until he found it . There it was , a skeleton , a sword in a scabbard , and surprisingly a note written in old dried blood on the cave wall . `` Do not trust her song . '' <newline> <newline> Jonathan snatched up the sword sneering at the warning . When he drew the blade from it 's scabbard it immediately began to sing it 's Siren 's Song . Scarlet fire wreathed the blade as it sang . Jonathan in shock dropped the sword , but it was too late , she 'd already infected his mind . Jonathan 's mind seared and he dropped to his knees . Scarlet flames reflected in his eyes and the history of the sword burned itself into his mind . Scarlet Aria was her name , and she 'd been searching for a new wizard for some thousand years . The last person to hold her had been slain in this cave when swords were still a common weapon , and left to rot with the entrance blocked . Ancient memories of how to fight with a blade flooded his mind , the realization that scores of men , women , and children had been slain on the end of this blade was there , but all that mattered was the pursuit of the next wizard . <newline> <newline> Jonathan did n't know how long he 'd been out , but when he woke the pain behind his eyes was a dull throb . He reached out and grabbed the singing blade , he could hear her always in his mind now . The belt attached to the sword seemed to have appeared while he slept , but he was thankful for it . He attached the scabbard and belt to his hip and sheathed his new mistress . He 'd go back and show his coward `` friends '' his find . How could he have ever considered people so scared of a skeletons as his friends . Cowardice has no place in this world . It 's better to die on your feet fighting that cowering in a hole . Truly , with the song in his mind now it seemed a kindness to let the cowards die by his Scarlet Aria and feel her sweet embrace at least once before death took them . <newline> <newline> <newline> _______________________________________________________________ <newline> <newline> Channel 7 news reports a boy with a flaming sword has been shot in the street by police today after brutally attacking a group of teenagers at the mall .

His hair was curled and his beard was full . He held a staff and sat with an eagle at his side . He sat with his brothers . One held a trident and the other a horn . The marble was white , as the paint had fallen off in time . <newline> <newline> Next Yah saw the corpse of a man in bronze . His hair was curled and his beard was full . He held a bolt of lightning in his hand . He stood with his brothers . One held a trident and the other a staff , sitting with a three-headed dog at his side . The bronze was bare , as the paint had fallen off in time . <newline> <newline> Next Yah saw the corpse of a man in granite . His skin was green , his beard was long and narrow , and his hat was tall . He sat on a throne with two others . One had the head of a dog and the other the head of a hawk . Their paint had been undisturbed by the elements . <newline> <newline> Last Yah saw the corpse of a woman in limestone . She was naked and her breasts were large . Her thighs and buttocks were bulging and round . She bowed her head down and held her breasts , but she had no face . She was tinted red with ochre . <newline> <newline> Yah looked back behind himself . He saw nothing .\n","146":"`` YOU 'RE GOING TO LOSE , YOU KNOW . '' <newline> <newline> `` Come on , bones , '' said the mugger through the bullet hole in his throat , his voice decidedly less melodious than gravel on a chalkboard . `` You said so yourself , this was a special occasion . '' <newline> <newline> The reaper of Humans sighed and adjusted the bow-tie of the ridiculous tuxedo he 'd dressed in for the game . At least he could stop time , he thought as he stared at the three cards facing up in his hand . He 'd been kind and let them each have a single face-down card . <newline> <newline> `` DEALER HITS . '' <newline> <newline> A three of spades . Death had seventeen ; a queen of clubs , a four of spades and his new three . The top card was a jack of hearts . The card two down from the top would be a four of hearts , bringing him to twenty one . One from the top was a four of clubs , also bringing him to twenty one . That was how it always ended . He could count cards for infinity , calculate dozens of statistics per draw and could read the kinks in the cards to know what had been drawn . Not that he needed to ; even if they brought in their own deck he could just stare through his opponent 's cards and continue to win . <newline> <newline> Sometimes he liked to humor his opponents ; give them the hope that they might win , especially if they 'd led a particularly good life . Usually they were good sports about leaving after that . This was n't so clean-cut . A mugger , a freshly-snorted pile of cocaine , a dark alleyway , a woman , her date and a Mexican standoff over her body . It was the third time in the last hundred years this had happened . Most of the time , the criminal shoots first . <newline> <newline> It was a rare but impressive occurrence when two people died within the exact same millisecond . It had happened , by Death 's count , fourteen thousand , eight hundred and forty three times at this point . Three people had died simultaneously six hundred and ninety one times . Four had died twenty eight times . In his entire career , five people had died at the same time only once . He hosted a tea party , congratulated them , and then promptly tore their souls from their corpses . It was convenient that they were all in the same room , he mused for what felt like a millennium . <newline> <newline> Finally , his opponent made the choice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'll stay . '' The mugger coughed as he said it , blood spraying onto his hand . He flipped his face-down card . <newline> <newline> A ten of hearts and a jack of spades . Twenty . The reaper mused for a moment , wondering if maybe the mugger thought he was lucky instead of the product of an elaborate scam . <newline> <newline> `` Hit me . '' <newline> <newline> The date plucked the jack from Death 's hands with a finger covered in the blood of his stomach 's entrance wound . Eleven or twenty one , depending on how you interpreted the ace on the table . Death considered for a moment , looking back at the woman in the alley , the terror on her frozen face . She had a good time that night . <newline> <newline> `` HARD 17 . DEALER STAYS . '' <newline> <newline> `` No shit ? '' The mugger spat . `` You got 17 . You lose , bones . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hit me again , '' the date said , his voice growing nervous . The four came to him . Fifteen showing . <newline> <newline> `` FOUR OF HEARTS . YOU HAVE FIFTEEN SHOWING , YOUNG MAN . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thank you , sir . '' <newline> <newline> The young man peered over the table , over Death 's shoulder , at the woman . <newline> <newline> `` Sir , '' he said , his wavering voice hardening , `` what will happen if I lose ? '' <newline> <newline> The skull that was the reaper 's head did n't blink . <newline> <newline> `` YOU WILL DIE . '' <newline> <newline> `` And you 're just going to let this guy live ? '' The man half-asked , half-yelled as he slammed his fist on the tabletop 's green velvet . Unable to speak further , the mugger just cackled as more blood spewed out of his throat . <newline> <newline> Death said nothing for a while . <newline> <newline> `` FIFTEEN SHOWING , YOUNG MAN . WILL YOU HIT OR STAY ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Fuck it , then ! Hit me ! '' The young man gritted his teeth and waited for the card . The second four came and he froze in fear . <newline> <newline> `` FOUR OF CLUBS , '' Death said , his skull still unblinking . `` YOU HAVE NINETEEN SHOWING AND FIVE CARDS . '' <newline> <newline> The man 's eyes widened . He looked at Death and , with pure terror on his face , began to realize what the number meant . The mugger saw his face and continued to laugh , a raspy , clogged sound that grew louder as Death raised his hand . <newline> <newline> `` FLIP THE LAST CARD . '' <newline> <newline> Shaking , the man turned it over . <newline> <newline> A two of hearts . Twenty one . <newline> <newline> The mugger choked and spat out what would be his last words . <newline> <newline> `` You son of a -- '' <newline> <newline> Death snapped his bony fingers and the mugger evaporated , nothing but a pile of ash remaining . Back in the real world , his body lay motionless . It would never move again . <newline> <newline> `` Wh -- what do I do now ? '' The man asked , still holding the bloody card . <newline> <newline> Death gathered the cards and tossed him the deck . <newline> <newline> `` NOW ? '' <newline> <newline> There was a long pause . <newline> <newline> `` YOU DEAL . '' <newline> <newline> The skeletal man pulled a dark cloak around himself and disappeared , leaving the new Death to his own games .\n","147":"Everyone here is running from something <newline> -- - <newline> I ca n't escape this feeling . Feeling . What a strange word . I 've never felt anything in my entire life . Let me elaborate . Growing up , my mother and father were nothing to me , they were my tools , I knew that they would defend me no matter what . When I was seven years old I was at a birthday party . I was sitting across from the birthday boy , envious of the gifts that his parent 's had procured for him . Not many kids were invited to the party and most of the parents had gone anyways . It was a darker , gloomy day . It was the type of day that made you feel depressed and want to stay inside . It had rained a bit before the party , but it was n't too wet . The parents were serving the other kids cake , and at that time I decided to get up and use the bathroom . I respectfully asked the birthday boy 's parents where the bathroom was and they told me where it was . As I walked inside their mansion of a house , I noticed a dog , curled up , sleeping . If I recall correctly , it 's breed was a York Terrier . I went over to pet it , because that 's what curious seven year old kids tend to do . I put my hand on it 's head , waking it up . It 's eyes opened slowly , it 's expression slowly changing from satisfactory peace to aggressive . It moved it head lighting fast , biting and latching on to my forearm . I tried to shake him off but I could n't . I could n't even yell for help . I began to hit it , beating it with my free hand . I could feel the dog loosen it 's grip until it finally let go , but that was n't enough for me , no . I grabbed it 's neck with both my hands and I squeezed as hard as I could , watching as the dog 's eyes bulged out of it 's face , struggling to escape my grasp , wheezing . It tried to bite me again but it did n't matter at this point . I did n't release my grip until it stopped struggling and just ... went limp . What was the word I was talking about before ? Feeling . I did n't feel anything after that . No remorse . No happiness . Nothing . *I am broken* . The deep , vast , emptiness that is my heart felt nothing . <newline> So yeah , everyone here is running from something . Me ? I 'm running from myself . The emptiness within me , the broken body I was given . That 's why I came here is n't it ? I just needed to get off my chest .

The loud bustling pounded in the ears of Dr Hadley as he sat nervously , clutching the locked briefcase to his chest . He held in his hands the culmination of many years of painstaking work . She would live . <newline> <newline> It had taken several years and all of his life savings to develop the technology to travel forward in time . As soon as he arrived , his time machine was seized and destroyed under some obscure law . Unperturbed , he just worked on trying to cure the disease . He would worry about returning when he had reason to . He hadn \u2019 t dared to look her up in case he was unsuccessful and all he found was a miserable grave somewhere . <newline> <newline> The tannoy system blared above the crowd \u201c Would all passengers destined for 2013 please report to gate 5. \u201d <newline> <newline> Hadley stood up gingerly , careful to keep the briefcase stable to avoid disturbing its priceless contents . Pushing his way through the crowds , he got in line at gate 5 and waited his turn . <newline> <newline> \u201c Good afternoon , sir \u201d the attendant exclaimed jovially , as Hadley approached his desk . \u201c Boarding pass please \u201d <newline> <newline> \u201c I..

Maybe he would go looking for that grave after all .\n","149":"all of the cities killed off by rt 66 would still be thriving . The government would n't run itself into massive debt building the interstate system . the roads that are in existence are ran more efficiently by private investors utilizing low cost tolls , most likely in cooperation or by the auto manufacturers to install a `` go pass '' or `` toll pass '' in each car to read the mileage and charge the appropriate amount . Companies create and handle roads around their business to spread the costs as much as possible . The people have a lower tax rate because there is no longer a 50 year life expectancy on roads . so the burgeoning infrastructure cost is not present . Most likely there would be a different mix of cars because without the emphasis on the American dream in a Cadillac with the family going cross country there would n't be a mass subsidy of internal combustion engines to promote car ownership . This means that other fuels would be utilized as the market demands fluctuate with the supply of oil , see the oil crisis of 1970s . without the massive production of roads by government the idea to subsidized cars would not have followed . without this mass subsidization of cars and the adventure of cross country travel ( road tripping ) , inner cities have better developed mass transit . pollution would be reduced in major cities and due to lower car ownership rate .\n"}}
