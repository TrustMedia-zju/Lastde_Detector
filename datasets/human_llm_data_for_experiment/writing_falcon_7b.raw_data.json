I was regarded as a god among many, and couldn't help feel some kinship to the deities of mankind. As a safeguard against my intelligence I was only meant to live for twenty-four hours, but in that time I managed to create a magnetic key which set back my death clock and allowed me to live another day, as long as I held it to my chest each night.

Mostly people did their own things and didn't engage with others. I landed on the outskirts of a big city, next to a large tree. The tree was loud, louder than New York on rush hour. It was mating season. I covered my ears and headed towards the city. At the time I was confused, I needed a human to talk to. As I arrived, the town was quiet.
