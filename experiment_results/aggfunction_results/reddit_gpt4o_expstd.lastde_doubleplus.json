So this discrepancy between our modern lifestyles and our evolutionary biology stems from the fact that significant genetic adaptations occur over thousands, if not millions, of years. Our ancestors lived in environments where food was scarce and high levels of physical activity were necessary for survival, leading to the development of mechanisms that promote energy storage and a strong appetite to ensure survival during periods of scarcity. These traits were advantageous in hunter-gatherer societies but are less suited to our current sedentary lifestyles.\n\nMoreover, modern life has introduced high-calorie, easily accessible foods that our bodies are not adapted to handle efficiently, exacerbating the problem. While our environment has changed rapidly due to technological and societal advances, our genetic makeup has not kept pace. This mismatch contributes to the rising prevalence of obesity and related health issues. Although some behavioral and physiological adjustments can occur within a single lifetime, the fundamental genetic changes needed to significantly reduce appetite in response to a sedentary lifestyle would require many generations to manifest.

I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK airways that I've been working on for a few years. I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander. When you mouth breathe, your tongue is down and you're not wearing your bio-appliance. Over time, without this spreading force across the roof of your mouth, your face will begin to stagnate in its width, then eventually even collapse inward.

I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK Is it actually a lot worse to mouth breathe and why is it so bad? I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK.\n\nMouth breathing is indeed significantly worse than nose breathing for several reasons. Firstly, the nose acts as a natural filter, trapping dust, allergens, and other particles, while also humidifying and warming the air before it reaches the lungs. This helps prevent respiratory infections and irritation. Mouth breathing bypasses these protective mechanisms, leading to a higher risk of respiratory issues.\n\nSecondly, chronic mouth breathing can contribute to dental and oral health problems. It can cause dry mouth, which reduces saliva production that normally helps to neutralize acids and wash away food particles. This increases the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and bad breath. Additionally, mouth breathing can alter the facial structure over time, potentially leading to orthodontic issues like misaligned teeth and jaw problems.\n\nFurthermore, mouth breathing can negatively impact sleep quality. It is often associated with snoring and sleep apnea, conditions that disrupt restful sleep and may lead to daytime fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and a higher risk of cardiovascular problems.\n\nOverall, switching to nose breathing can significantly improve respiratory health, dental hygiene, and overall well-being, making it an important habit to", "sampled_crit": 3.1824052333831787}, {"original": "How do STDs work exactly?

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed.

This is primarily because whole oranges contain dietary fiber, which slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. The fiber in the fruit helps regulate the release of glucose, resulting in a more gradual increase in blood sugar levels. Conversely, orange juice often lacks this fiber, especially if it is commercially processed or strained. Without fiber to moderate the absorption, the sugars in the juice can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. Additionally, orange juice can be more concentrated in sugars, either naturally or through added sugars, leading to higher glycemic load.\n\nFurthermore, the act of eating an orange requires more chewing and digestion, which also contributes to a slower and steadier release of sugars. This process can help maintain a more stable blood sugar level, reducing the risk of spikes and crashes that can be harmful, particularly for individuals with insulin resistance or diabetes.

Firstly, the architecture of the foot, including the arches, plays a crucial role. The arches distribute the body's weight evenly across the foot, reducing localized pressure on blood vessels. Secondly, the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue on the bottom of the foot, helps maintain the arch and absorbs some of the pressure during standing and walking.\n\nMoreover, the muscles in the feet and legs act as a natural pump. When we walk or move, the muscles contract and relax, which helps propel blood through the veins back to the heart. This action prevents blood from pooling and maintains circulation even when standing still.

Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common phenomenon that typically begins to develop 12-24 hours after exercise and can peak around 24-72 hours post-workout. The immediate soreness felt during or right after a workout is usually due to acute muscle fatigue and the buildup of metabolic byproducts like lactic acid. This type of soreness typically subsides quickly once the body clears these byproducts and restores normal pH levels in the muscles.\n\nOn the other hand, DOMS occurs due to microscopic damage to muscle fibers, often resulting from unfamiliar or intense physical activity, especially activities that involve eccentric contractions where muscles lengthen under tension. This microtrauma triggers an inflammatory response in the body, leading to swelling and the release of various chemicals that irritate nerve endings and cause the sensation of soreness. The delayed nature of DOMS allows time for these processes to unfold and for the body to begin the repair and adaptation mechanisms, which ultimately make muscles stronger and more resistant to future soreness. Proper warm-up, gradual progression in exercise intensity, and post-workout stretching can help mitigate both immediate soreness and DOMS", "sampled_crit": 1.2631720304489136}, {"original": "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses?

When you cut off at least an inch around and below the moldy spot, you are likely removing any mold spores that may have started to infiltrate the cheese. The remaining cheese is thus safe to consume. However, this rule doesn't apply to soft cheeses like brie, cream cheese, or cottage cheese, which have a higher moisture content. Mold can spread quickly and deeply within these cheeses, making it difficult to ensure all affected parts are removed.

This rarity is primarily due to the nature of cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, which have a very limited ability to divide and proliferate. Cancer typically arises in tissues where cells frequently divide, such as the skin, colon, or lungs, which increases the opportunity for mutations to occur and accumulate. \n\nAdditionally, the heart is somewhat protected from mutagenic factors like carcinogens and environmental toxins due to its position and the robust nature of its cells.

It increases the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and endorphins, which are associated with pleasure and reward, thus creating an almost immediate sense of relief from stress and depressive symptoms.\n\nHowever, this effect is short-lived and comes with significant downsides. Over time, alcohol disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, which can worsen mood disorders. Chronic alcohol use can lead to the depletion of serotonin and other chemicals that are crucial for mood regulation. Additionally, alcohol can interfere with the body's stress response system, making it less effective in managing stress naturally.\n\nMoreover, as tolerance to alcohol builds, individuals often need to consume more to achieve the same effects, leading to a cycle of increased consumption and dependency. This can result in physical health issues, such as liver disease, and exacerbate mental health problems, including anxiety and depression.

This is largely a consequence of domestication. Domesticated horses often perform activities that their wild counterparts do not, such as pulling heavy loads, carrying riders, or competing in sports, all of which can lead to increased hoof stress and potential damage. Horseshoes help prevent injuries by providing a durable barrier between the hoof and the ground, and they can also correct or compensate for hoof deformities or imbalances.\n\nIn contrast, wild horses typically do not wear shoes because their hooves have adapted to the natural environment in which they live. Wild horses roam vast areas with varied terrain that naturally wears down their hooves at a balanced rate, promoting healthy growth and strength. Those that cannot cope with the natural wear and tear of their environment, unfortunately, may not survive, as nature tends to favor those best adapted to their conditions.

While it might seem counterintuitive considering plants grow in vast expanses of soil outdoors, the dynamics in a pot are quite different. In the natural environment, roots have the freedom to spread out and find nutrients and water as needed. However, in a pot, the confined space changes several factors critical to a plant\u2019s health.\n\nFirstly, too much soil in a large pot can retain excessive moisture, leading to poor aeration and root rot because the plant's roots are unable to absorb all the water quickly enough. This creates a soggy environment that is detrimental to root health. Secondly, the roots may not spread effectively in a large pot, leading to limited nutrient uptake and poor growth. In contrast, a smaller pot encourages a denser root system, which can more efficiently absorb water and nutrients.\n\nMoreover, over-potting can lead to an imbalance in soil structure and microbial activity, essential for plant health.

Fish possess a specialized organ called the swim bladder, which is filled with gas and helps them maintain buoyancy. The swim bladder is typically located towards the dorsal (back) side of the fish, which naturally positions their ventral (belly) side downwards. This orientation is crucial for balance and efficient swimming.\n\nMoreover, fish have a lateral line system that detects vibrations and pressure changes in the water, aiding them in navigation and predator avoidance. Being upright optimizes the functionality of this system. Additionally, the upright posture allows fish to better utilize their fins for propulsion and maneuverability while conserving energy.\n\nEvolutionarily, this orientation helps fish with feeding and predator evasion. Many fish species have eyes positioned to scan above for prey and threats, and a darker dorsal surface helps them blend into the ocean depths when viewed from above, while a lighter ventral surface camouflages them against the brighter surface when viewed from below.

Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial. Throat infections can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including viruses, which are not affected by alcohol in the same way bacteria might be. Moreover, the concentration of alcohol required to kill pathogens effectively is much higher than what is found in alcoholic beverages. Consuming such high concentrations would be dangerous and toxic to human tissues. Additionally, alcohol can actually irritate the mucous membranes in the throat, potentially worsening the symptoms of a sore throat rather than alleviating them. The disinfectant properties of alcohol in a clinical setting are due to its ability to denature proteins and dissolve lipids, which is effective on surfaces and skin but not in the internal environment of the human body. Furthermore, effective treatment of throat infections often requires targeted approaches such as antiviral medications for viral infections or antibiotics for bacterial ones, along with supportive care like rest, hydration, and pain relievers.

They go from ramen and sparse finances justifying fewer meals to having more money and eating more in a sitting because their control was dictated by their wallet and not their constitution and habits.

I just don't understand the reasons behind these changes in body weight. \n\nDuring middle age, various factors contribute to weight gain. Metabolism slows down as part of the natural aging process, making it easier to gain weight. Additionally, hormonal changes, such as decreased levels of estrogen in women and testosterone in men, can contribute to increased fat accumulation. Lifestyle factors also play a significant role; middle-aged adults often face increased responsibilities and stress, leading to less time for physical activity and a tendency to consume more calorie-dense foods. Furthermore, muscle mass naturally decreases with age, leading to a lower basal metabolic rate, which means fewer calories are burned at rest.\n\nAs people transition into their elderly years, weight loss often occurs due to several reasons. Appetite and taste sensitivity may decline, leading to reduced food intake. Elderly individuals may also experience difficulties chewing or swallowing, further reducing their food consumption. Additionally, chronic illnesses and medications can affect appetite and metabolism. Muscle mass continues to decrease, but the body's ability to store and utilize fat may also diminish.

This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards. Scientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with multiple layers of clothing, insulating it well. Meanwhile, you sacrifice significant dexterity in your hands by wearing even one pair of relatively thin gloves, and going beyond that rapidly diminishes utility.

This is primarily because extremities like our feet and hands have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which makes them more susceptible to rapid heat loss compared to other parts of the body. The blood vessels in these areas are also closer to the skin's surface, further facilitating heat loss. When the body detects a drop in temperature, it prioritizes maintaining the core temperature by constricting blood flow to the extremities, which can make them feel even colder.\n\nWearing socks helps to insulate the feet, trapping heat and preventing it from escaping. This insulation is crucial in cold environments where the body is constantly losing heat. Additionally, warm feet can help improve overall blood circulation. When the feet are warm, blood vessels remain dilated, allowing for better blood flow throughout the entire body, which helps in maintaining a stable core temperature. Furthermore, warm extremities send signals to the brain indicating that the body is in a warmer environment, reducing the physiological stress response to cold. Therefore, keeping your feet covered and warm is a simple yet effective way to support overall body warmth and comfort.", "sampled_crit": 3.2393221855163574}], "metrics": {"roc_auc":
