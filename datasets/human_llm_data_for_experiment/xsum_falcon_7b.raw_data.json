A spokesman said Number 10 expected the council to \"respect\" the court ruling. Separately, the chief executive of the organisation which manages Grenfell Tower has agreed to \"step aside\". Kensington and Chelsea Council leaders abruptly ended their meeting after 20 minutes, claiming an open meeting would \"prejudice\" the forthcoming public inquiry. On Thursday appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to lead the public inquiry into the deaths of at least 80 people. Angry protests followed after the abandoned meeting, which Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded a \"fiasco\". He shouted: \"An absolute fiasco, this is why I am calling for your resignation.\" Mr Atkinson, the Labour group leader on Kensington and Chelsea Council, told the BBC he was \"ashamed\" of the authority. He accused the leaders of \"hiding from residents, they have been",

Two people were seriously hurt and 31 others injured in the explosion on Saturday evening. The site remains a crime scene as police investigate the cause. Christine Pickup was at home with her three grandchildren at the time of the explosion. They escaped with cuts and bruises. She went to the hub earlier to find out when she can get back into her home. \"I walked out in my pyjamas and a phone in my hand,\" she said. \"Friends have put clothes on my back.

Weeks later events overshadowed his win as the EU referendum result went against the wishes of almost 60% of Londoners and Mr Khan became a cheerleader for an \"open\" London. And in March, he was faced with the news all London mayors dread, yet expect - a terrorist attack in the capital. A year on and Sadiq Khan remains a popular figure in the capital.

        "Syriza's election victory raises some difficult questions for the other countries using the currency and for the European institutions. The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money provided",

The former Barcelona and FC Bayern manager has made City the team to beat in the Premier League, according to Rangel. \"He's shown everywhere that he's been that he's a top manager,\" he said. \"At the moment Man City are looking like the best team in the UK.\" Rangel says he is relishing the prospect of trying to stop Sergio Aguero.

        "Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey. About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production. Their concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC. The questionnaire was sent to members of the British Leafy Salad Association and British Summer Fruits, which represent 90% of growers in their sector. There was a big response. Three-quarters of growers completed the survey,",

However, Sanmi Odelusi and Nathan Delfouneso clinched victory for the Seasiders with late strikes. Potts fired his side ahead in the 33rd minute, arriving late in the box to convert Colin Daniel's cross from the left. Blackpool added a second in the 56th minute when Luke Joyce was caught in possession and Flores took advantage to unleash a fierce strike into the corner. Flores missed a chance to make it 3-0 and Carlisle hit back when substitute Ibehre headed home. But just when Carlisle were threatening to salvage something from the game, another error at the back cost them dearly as Odelusi struck for their third goal.

A spokesman for the government said it recognised the work done by the police. Ms Barnes urged Patrick McLoughlin \"to provide a permanent and comprehensive solution which provides full and continuing reimbursement for the taxpayers of Kent\". She said Operation Stack was putting \"immense pressure\" on the community and the police, \"drawing dozens of officers away from their policing duties each day\".

The Scottish government said the new processes would give local communities a stronger voice. It said the changes, which will come into force on 28 June, would improve arrangements for public consultation and community engagement in the wider pharmacy application process, as well as introducing statutory timeframes for health boards to reach decisions. NHS boards will also be required to apply new tests when considering pharmacy applications in designated and clearly identified rural or remote areas.

On its Twitter account, it said \"Security Arrangements for the Defence of Maiduguri has been upgraded to handle any planned attack\". The BEF represents influential people in the state, including former government ministers and civil servants.

        "The quantity of goods bought rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was stronger growth than economists had been expecting. The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes. That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks. \"A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,\" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year. Economists prefer to look at figures over three months, which smooth out volatile moves from month to month. \"We shouldn't get too carried away by these figures. After all, the retail sales figures are very volatile on a month-by-month basis. And the heatwave in June provided a",

Aden Flint then headed the visitors in front before half-time. But Helder Costa's volley made it 2-2, and Cavaleiro scored from the spot after Flint's handball to win it. There was more drama right at the very end of the match when Marlon Pack's header was cleared off the line, with City's players and supporters feeling it had snuck over. But Wolves survived to record back-to-back victories for the first time since August, moving them above the Robins to 15th in the Championship table in the process.

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year. Such lenders are unlikely to increase their SVRs",

The court said it brought in extra staff to process the claims submitted by shareholders, who were concerned that 18 September, the day VW's manipulations were uncovered a year ago, may be the deadline to file.

If implemented quickly, the proposals for a Greek exit from the currency union would raise the stakes, as well as the political and economic stakes, considerably, for each of the other countries using the euro, which could in turn create a domino effect.\nIn Greece, the initial proposal of Tsipras and Varoufakis to have the ECB create a parallel euro is both risky and reckless. The central bank would be lending vast amounts of money to a rogue government that has just been elected on a mandate of dismantling the euro. So much hinges on the ECB's willingness to buy these bonds without knowing",
