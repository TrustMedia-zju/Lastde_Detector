Calculators usually overestimate your protein goal a fair bit though, so it\u2019s up to you to decide on your own a bit. You probably do not need that much, but that being said it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t benefit from that much if not more. If you are working out hard, in more bodybuilding style workouts looking to gain as much muscle mass possible, this isn\u2019t an unreasonable amount of protein.

We did catch some fish, mainly small ones I can't remember, but the spiney-ass carp are the ones that stuck with me.

        "your food has mold so you throw it out. Except for cheese, you just cut off that bit and keep going. Why is molded cheese still safe to eat, unlike bread or chicken? There's a combination of reasons. The most significant one is that cheese mold itself usually isn't dangerous. Most varieties of mold that commonly grow on cheese just changd the flavor. They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content. And if you have a hard cheese like cheddar, and it gets wet and then molds, it's also not safe because of the moisture. Then soft cheeses like Brie, you'll get opinions both ways. Some people say it's safe if you cut off a good inch or two. Some say it's not safe at all. I would not eat moldy soft cheese.",

Once the bone drops away the gum follows.

Your body can generate energy to fuel your muscles in different ways. At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy. This chemical that",

Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing. Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. Humans are specialized in... well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances.

And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of",

This is a widely accepted theory from the famous linguist Noam Chomsky. However, the system has to be \u201cpowered on\u201d. Babies need exposure to language in order to actually develop language.

        "Why does salt make everything taste better? Why do humans like it? Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain wrong. Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed. If it's too \"quiet\", not enough of the food to taste, or it's bland, we may not taste something if it never reaches the threshold. So what does this have to do with salt? Some neuron cells have what are called gated channels",

Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die.",

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed.

Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference.

        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. Before germ theory, people believed in Humorism or the four humors. They were yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit. To anyone who finds this interesting: there\u2019s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels. When it separates, you see the dark clots at the bottom (black bile), the red blood cells above that (regular blood), the white layer of white blood cells (phlegm) and the yellowing serum on",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that",

The liver's primary job is to make compounds in your blood take on a form that's easier for the kidneys to excrete; in practice this means making them more soluble in water.

The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and the stomach, it's the first pass which tries to balance everything in a way that works for your body.

Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries.

Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to",

        "why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses? Wild horses who can't cope without them die:) But the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means",

Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. This is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains.

Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently.

This starts temporarily, but eventually causes permanent damage to the capillaries in the face, causing that rosey red look of a heavy drinker. I am an Allergist. This is garbage.

Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that\u2019s strong enough to allow for incredibly complex chemistry and yet won\u2019t dissolve the molecules that make up the organism.

And while it\u2019s technically possible that there could be life that\u2019s not carbon-based, it\u2019s probably unlikely. This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y\u2019know, live. The way carbon forms strong covalent bonds with itself means it can form molecules like DNA in a way that other atoms just can\u2019t.

Often like 2/3 the amount of carbs of normal sugar candy so those candies arent safe either. They keytones are what kills us when we neglect our blood sugar, they turn our blood acid and shut down our kidneys. When we are hyperglycemic we burn exclusively fat and produce way more keytones than our bodies can handle, leading to diabetic keto acidosis. This is what I was in in the above example.

Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage. Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth. The second big thing to remember is that all living things are essentially just chemical processes. You put two molecules next to each other and things start to happen.

They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain.

Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis. When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad.",

Horses do have an edge on us and can out-distance us, if only partially because we've spent centuries breeding them to be exceptional at marathon running. For us the factors that give us an edge are: * We can sweat and don't have a lot of fur so we're pretty efficient at cooling * Fabulous leg muscles * Bipedal motion keeps our lungs and heart able to function separately from our running * We are capable of \"anaerobic respiration\". That means our cells can keep producing energy (albeit less efficiently) after the oxygen in our blood isn't sufficient to power them. (First off, we have to talk about people in decent shape.

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting",

If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve.

They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't",

Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong.

You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. Secondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%). Nearly all SIDS cases present with at least one of the above risk factors, excluding bed-sharing. Additionally, groups get conflated - babies which are bottle fed at",

How much longer could that person theoretically survive as compared to an average one? You need the vitamins and minerals that get lost through metabolism and urine. Additionally amino acids cannot be fully recycled so you would need to add those as well, or the body will take apart muscle including the heart muscle to obtain those amino acids (protein = multiple amino acids). If those 3 points are met, then yes the obese person would only starve once their fat storage runs out. Depending on degree of obesity, this will take over a year.

        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain. Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got.

But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap.

Most of them suck at it compared to animals that live in the water. Humans don't have an \"optional swimming feature\". We instinctively know how to do a very laborious paddle. When people \"learn to swim\" it has to do with training them to be better at it. For example, the body is (usually) naturally buoyant, but if you position yourself certain ways in water you still sink. So you learn things like how to float on your back or how to do a backstroke, which is extremely low-energy. Then you learn specific strokes that help you move faster or use less energy.

The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...).

Similarly, it bothers me when people require a purpose for a specific animal or species to exist. We can assign a benefit to the ecosystem. But it's usually arbitrary. Things just be. And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed. If you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier. But as humans we hate loss so we see a species that existed, being killed off as damaging. To take it even a step further, when people complain that humans are evil because they damage the environment. No, we change it. There is no objective, structural",

What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes",

They are arbitrary lines drawn around perceived differences that have been reinforced via social structures. There is little to no genetic, physiological, or physical differentiation between different ethnicities or races that does not partially rely also on social classifications. Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\". Second, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone.

It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently.

That's why the body decomposes. It starts with just some chemical bonds breaking. But also any bacteria that was trying to get in your body stops being impeded by your immune system. So that starts moving in and breaking things down too, leaving behind toxins. We can certainly use machines to make the heart beat and lungs move. That will get your circulatory system running.

The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters",

I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander.

Most viral particles quickly become non-viral if heated enough.\n\nBut once an organism's genome is cut and reassembled, they will never behave the same way again.\n\nSo is it feasible to destroy a virus with time?\n\nYes\n\nFor a non-viral pathogen \u2014 such as an opportunistic antibiotic-resistant bacterium that has adapted resistance mechanisms to antibiotics \u2014 the answer is no. When that pathogen infects a cell, any damage to the cell would make the organism even more resistant to antibiotics.\n\nBut if an antibiotic-resistant pathogen is exposed to radiation, it quickly breaks down, in theory destroying the DNA.\n\nHere's how: The organism would have a \"memory\" that any time it was exposed to a sufficient amount of radiation, it would become resistant to it.

        "Why the elderly body odor is so strong? As a person ages the body naturally slows down. This includes all parts of the body. Whereas a young body has its body heat, metabolism and immune system. As your age, the body starts losing its youthful appearance and strength. And this change is seen in the skin area, hair and muscles too. The skin produces more oil and the hairs also increase accordingly. The skin become less flexible which again causes body odor at an earlier stage of age than most other people. The elderly can have thick hair (usually grey or white) which too produce increased amounts of pungent oils like oleic oils, linoleic and lauric oils. Body odor starts at the age of 50, depending on your body type and lifestyle. Aging is a slow process but can speed up with time. A person can also get old easily and it takes longer time to mature. But there are some things to keep in mind to prevent body odor.\n",

        "Why does salt make everything taste better? Why do humans like it? Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain wrong. The reason salt tastes good is because it changes the way food tastes. Salt helps us find food. Salt makes food that is lost or hard to find harder to find. The question now is why does salt taste so good? What are the molecules of salt that make it taste so good?\n\nSalt is made up of sodium and water. The table salt that we are familiar with is made from sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide, it is actually just sodium chloride and water mixed together.\n\nSalt is great for food preservation and keeping food sweet, it also helps us locate food that is under other foods. Salt also helps us taste food. The combination of the sodium and the water make this a very attractive substance. As mentioned earlier, salt can make food that is lost or hard to find easier to find.

        "What do our sinuses actually do? Not really. This ELI5 answer misses the point completely. First, the rate of air flow though our nasal passages is so negligible that we really need no excuse to just breathe normally. Secondly, your sinuses are filled with mucus.

I guess your question is why do babies cry when they are hurt or upset. Babies respond to threats the way dogs do. To scare them. If you don't move fast enough, the dog will see an opportunity and get in on it. That's when they bark and fight over it. Same goes for small children, who are afraid of you. If you don't move fast enough, they will notice",
        "Why do some medications say to not consume grapefruit while taking them? Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less common orange fruit.\n\nThere is a simple explanation for those. They contain a substance called a ketone, which is metabolized into acetaldehyde, the active metabolite of many medications. Acetaldehyde has a short half-life and is metabolized rather quickly by your body. Acetaldehyde is a powerful metabolite that can damage your brain and your heart in high doses. While acetaldehyde is used by many of your body systems to produce essential compounds (such as acetyl-L-carnitine, which stimulates your energy production), it also causes the most damage when the levels increase to too much through high intake of fat and carb-based foods. I am not saying all of these fruits are high in acetaldehyde, but most do.\n\nThis means that these fruits are a possible reason you need to be careful",

Resistance of our bones or of the insect itself?\nThe insect is made out of a super strong biocellular structure, and the human's bone is not. If you slam your fist into an insect without thinking about how strong the insect is, or how thick the insect is, you just destroyed the insect's shell.  The human being is still in pain but the damage stops after a minute and you can go back to whatever you were doing.  The insect doesn't have any way to heal itself, the damage has been done.",
        "yellow is considered a primary color, but our eyes detect red, blue and green. Is it \"just\" because of how we name things?\nNo, most of the things we're familiar with are based of only the primary colors, not the secondary ones. For example, no painting or photograph has yellow in it, because the color yellow just can't be seen in natural light.\nIf a photo or painting shows a yellow object and the camera was turned in a certain way, could we see the yellow object? I'm not sure there would be a way, but couldn't we see the yellow (not natural) object with our eyes even if it weren't in the photo or painting?\nWe can't \"see\" colors. Our brain (or mind) see them as colors, but actually see them as variations of one single color. This is exactly why we can't see blue/white, because our brain sees them as only white and there's no way to distinguish",

We're omnivores, and we didn't become omnivorous for no reason.  This is the same reason we developed tools and fire and how we developed a global economy.

There are multiple factors involved in these things - genetics, the brain, hormones, genetics, life experience, diet, alcohol, and etc. But why does alcohol make these things worse while it is helping in a short-term situation?\nProbably due to how it affects the blood. Since it reduces your inhibitions, it makes us more susceptible to stress and depression. The alcohol might also be making depression worse with chemicals in the brain and hormone changes. It's a whole lot of reasons, though.",

If a large needle was inserted from the shoulder, it'd cause some minor issues, but it wouldn't stop the magnet.

The best way to see traits of an ethnic group is to examine physical features, not just an organ.  edit: spelling\nBut that would mean we shouldn't care what people look like? I doubt we should judge someone solely based on how attractive or unattractive they are.\nWe should definitely care. An organ is only a part of someone's body. It doesn't represent a complete person. But for example, I don't believe in sex selection, so I think we should judge people on what they physically look like, rather than on an arbitrary physical trait.\nBut why shouldn't we just do that based on what you look like? Isn't that discriminatory?\nNo, it isn't. Why is it any more or less discriminatory than saying \"I don't like short",
        "why you never hear about the human heart getting cancer, are there other organs that don\u2019t get cancer? The heart muscle itself, not the actual lining of the lungs, blood vessels, or any other organs in this list.\n\nWhy don\u2019t people ever study how lungs and hearts get cancer? They seem so similar. They\u2019re both structures that contain blood, oxygen, and chemicals, that contract and relax, and they get inflamed, etc. They seem so similar from a medical standpoint and yet they\u2019re completely different when you look at the cells.\n\nWhy do heart diseases and lung diseases tend to have many genetic factors but are not that similar overall? Do they have slightly different mechanisms that cause them to happen or is there something that really makes them so different? I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s the question that\u2019s on my mind, and I probably never will, but it\u2019s a question that",
        "Why aren\u2019t our bodies adapting to our more sedentary lifestyles by reducing appetites? Because evolution doesn't work that quickly. So this could take some time to happen. If you want to get thin, eat less or work out more or whatever, it might be worth considering your lifestyle.\nWhat you're talking about is called dieting, and that has a pretty dismal track record.  Just a bit if advice?\nYeah, I was going to say something about how dieting doesn't really work, but realized people would just ignore that advice.\nIf you're overweight, its the best thing for you.  But if its a healthy amount of weight with no health or quality of life issues, who give a shit?  You'll only live a few years as an overweight person and you'll have a better chance at a longer life by maintaining your weight.  Its about health, not appearance.",
        "Why do men have bigger feet in contrast to women? Why aren't their average foot sizes equal? An important note is that in addition to height, body type plays a big role. So a tall, muscular guy has longer average feet than a shorter, less muscular guy.\nWe walk on the tip of our toes, so there's a certain proportion of that. When you get to our width at a certain length then the shoe size gets very important I suppose.\nNot sure what type of people you're talking to, but the vast majority I know have the same size foot",
        "Why is death irreversible? Your tissue is made of cells, which are basically tiny living things. When they die, the things they are made out of cease to function, and you die. How does that happen?\nThey don't really die.  I think they become dormant. It is not that they do not exist at all, it is that you are living in a non-functioning machine that will shut down.\nIn order for that to happen, a bunch of the chemicals that allow the cells to function must be eliminated or inactivated. In theory, you couldn't get rid of all the chemicals that would allow cells to divide. How do you think that would work, in this non-functional machine that will cease to function?\nWell, one thing is for sure. If we stop eating, there would be an end to human life. I think that happens with fish, too. It would be a lot like hibernation.\nDo you have a source that",
        "Why are Dolphins specifically friendly towards humans only and not towards other animals/fish like sharks? Dolphins - like humans - are highly social and communicative creatures. Are they just not social or is it simply because human societies don't exist everywhere?\nProbably because people are more aggressive to dolphins than to other animals.  Same reason that dolphins are considered smart, they\u2019re pretty smart, and they\u2019re not a big problem when you\u2019re a tourist at an aquarium.  Once all the people start swimming on beaches and in the water with dolphins you\u2019ll probably see some aggression, and if they start being killed in mass numbers that\u2019s something else.",
        "why is it recommended you wait 2-3 days before working out muscles again but people in jobs like movers lift heavy things all day multiple days every week and no one says 'you should take 2-3 days off between sets'  is this different from lifting just fine when working a high volume job?\nBecause the body does a number on it trying to repair/grow, and it takes a while for things to be normal again. Same as for a run or long bike ride.\nthat's what I figured, so it's just a way to \"re-build\" muscles to be as robust as they were before you started? I have some trouble understanding how that's different from a long ride on a bike, or even just getting up and walking around between sets.",
        "Why does the human body jerk/shock itself awake sometimes while trying to sleep? This thing is called a [hypnic jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerks), and it's a well-known fact that we do this to improve our ability to focus while asleep. But why is it doing that, you might ask?\n\nScientists have found out why, thanks to an unusual case of sleep-induced epilepsy.\n\nIn an unusual case study published recently in the medical journal The Lancet EClinesy, researchers describe how, after studying the electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with hypnic jerks, they could explain the phenomenon.\n\nWhat causes a hypnic jerk?\n\nHypnic jerks are described as being very short in duration, lasting around a millisecond, with a sudden surge in the strength of an involuntary muscle.\n\nThey\u2019re known to occur in people who are trying to",
        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is decompression sickness. Also called decompression sickness. What are the symptoms of decompression sickness? In diving people really only get it on their first dive. Usually they'll experience a headache, nausea, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms of compression sickness are generally more on the skin or abdomen. It actually starts off with a little tightness in the chest. What's also concerning is the fact that this can be life-threatening. You can have something called hyperbaric sickness where you've got swelling that goes into your brain. What's important to look out for is getting decompression sickness if you're doing dry-suit diving.\n\nWhat's also concerning is the fact that this can be life-threatening.

        "is it actually a lot worse to mouth breathe and why is it so bad? I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK airways and this topic has peaked my interests.\nIt's worse for your airways if you don't know how to breathe properly, so my guess would be that you could get sick more efficiently, but it's not really the issue here.\nso is it just a thing where you feel like your mouth is closing and you can barely breathe for 30 seconds when you are at home? That is super weird.\nNot exactly, but it's very noticeable to me. I guess if you're good at breathing and don't use your mouth when you breathe, it wouldn't bother you.\nI know we are in a thread about this, but what would happen if you did breath differently? You'd have an easier time breathing just by mouth? It would seem it would be the worst when you do it when you are not familiar with it",
        "Refrigerate after opening, but not before? You're right about most dairy products being only pasteurized except for UHT milk in those box and bottled varieties. UHT milk contains only water and lactose so would not spoil within 48 hrs like pasteurized milk.\nHow does UHT milk not spoil in 48 hours? Isn't the lactose broken down and isn't it technically \"pasteurized\"?\nThe amount of lactose that goes into UHT milk is a fraction of what goes into the pasteurized milk.   It's literally only water and lactose. It does not pose the same threat of bacteria growth that conventional milk does.",
        "Why do human hips go bad so randomly? You\u2019d think runners and other athletes would get bad hips pretty often, but it seems like everyone gets bad hips at some point (other than my sister, who\u2019s never had one that I\u2019m aware of, but at least it makes the occasional story to tell).\nI used to get bad hips all the time as a kid, so I can totally relate.  Now that I\u2019m an adult, I have maybe two bad hips in my entire body....\nYou must have really low standards for bad hips. My hips were never really painful, but they never felt great because I\u2019ve been constantly getting rolled out and bruised. And now that I\u2019ve hit old age, my hip flexors are giving me trouble and the pain they gave me in the past is now in all the places where they used to be pain-free. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll get better",
        "In movies taking a bullet out of a wound and then putting a bandage on the wound seems to magically cure the wound. Is that all you are talking about? Like the movies where they show someone has a bullet wound and they heal magically. Are these movies all a bunch of fantasy? Should this not be possible? What is the explanation for why in movies the bullet does not immediately kill someone?  Thanks.\nIf it takes more than a few hours to fully heal a bullet wound, you should be dead, since you would likely have received a hemorrhage from the bullet.  I'm pretty sure the issue is simply that movies don't take enough time for the wound to properly heal. It really isn't that hard to make a hole in a bullet.",
        "Dinosaurs were around for 150m years. Why didn\u2019t they become more intelligent? Evolution doesn't have a goal. It doesn't plan the next step. It just goes through things until one of them \"works\".\nI know. I guess I really should have said \"was there any intelligence during this period of time?\"   I just don't understand how something that wasn't intelligent and strong enough to survive, can just evolve a brain that became large enough to \"think logically\".\nWhat exactly do you expect intelligent life to look like. This is so stupid I can't make a single logical connection to be able to help you out.\nI haven't made any at all lol.  I was just curious if there was really a need for it to evolve a very advanced brain. I really don't know.  Maybe I should ask that question under another sub.\nNo, you\u2019re really just fishing for \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t",
        "Why didn't the indigenous people who lived on the savannahs of Africa domesticate zebras in the same way that early European and Asians domesticated cattle?\nProbably because cattle was seen as food, zebra is not.\nBut they didn't see them exclusively as food. If you think about it, they domesticated zebras in the same way that they domesticated cattle: they used them as tools to drive herds of wild African camels into their settlements - hence the word \"domestication\", for the act of introducing a creature to domestication, if that makes sense.    If this was the case, why did the African peoples have to wait for the Europeans to conquer them?",
        "how are blood vessels under the feet not compressed to the point of blockage when standing? >During walking and standing balance the moments of compression fully distributed.  they have to be squeezed to get out\nI was reading it while standing and it looked fine while I stood...\nYeah the article was written in a way where if you are reading while laying down, you'll be too distracted by the foot issues to notice other points of concern.\nNot too bad.  Although the article was written with the assumption that the feet were the main problem for balance.  Interesting, I'll take your word for it.",
        "How is coffee healthy while other uppers like cocaine are bad for you? They work differently. Caffeine blocks your brain\u2019s and liver\u2019s chemical signals. Cocaine, on the other hand, sends these chemical signals into overdrive, causing more damage to the brain and liver.\n\nCaffeine is the biggest reason people don\u2019t do cocaine. Drinking coffee will not cause an overdose of cocaine, so most people consume more than they need, resulting in a mild overdose. However, people that are addicted on cocaine may drink and take more than they should, and are probably already addicted. There\u2019s also no health benefit to people that don\u2019t take cocaine. Caffeine does not cure your addiction or help if you are already hooked on cocaine, so it is probably not recommended. Drinking coke will eventually kill you too.\n\nPeople should also avoid drinking any other caffeinated drug, like sodas or energy drinks, because",
        "why are strong men fat >so then why wouldnt it turn into something more useful like dense muscle with all the training their doing? It does have some benefit to a strong man's physique but is it really so superior to a ripped guy?\n\nI dont think so. the ripped guy will have more and bigger muscles, but hes still bigger, not more so.\n\nIts like saying your bigger than a guy that works hard at a job vs someone that doesn't work as hard, that guy is gonna be bigger then you, but if you worked at that same job for the same amount of years, you would get some work done."
