Due to resource concerns, everyone must submit to a council their chosen manner of death at 150. The more amusing the death, the longer the council lets you live. In this brave new world, the pursuit of humor has become intertwined with the ultimate existential decision.\n\nThe council, comprised of a diverse group of individuals from comedians to philosophers, convenes monthly to review the death proposals. Each submission is meticulously evaluated for creativity, entertainment value, and the potential to leave a lasting impression. The applicants, eager to extend their days, come up with increasingly outlandish scenarios.\n\nOne elderly woman proposed to exit life via a catapult that would fling her into a pool of gelatin, sparking uproarious laughter and granting her an additional decade. Meanwhile, a retired engineer suggested being launched into space strapped to a rocket powered by homemade fireworks, earning him another 15 years.\n\nThis new societal norm has spurred a renaissance in arts and innovation, as people strive to design death scenarios that captivate the council\u2019s imagination.

For the Force to truly be balanced, an individual must experience both the Light Side and the Dark Side equally. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. \n\nIt is a radical perspective, yet it finds resonance in the Expanded Universe (EU) of Star Wars. Characters like Revan and Vergere have championed this philosophy, embodying the idea that the Force is not merely a binary struggle but a complex spectrum. Revan, a Jedi Knight turned Sith Lord, ultimately became a Grey Jedi, navigating the fine line between both sides of the Force. His journey illustrated the potential harmony that comes from understanding and mastering both aspects.\n\nVergere, with her teachings to Jacen Solo, further challenged the traditional dichotomy. She imparted wisdom that the Force is a unified whole, and clinging rigidly to one side limits an individual's true potential. Her lessons encouraged introspection and a deeper connection to the Force, beyond the dogma of the Jedi or the Sith.\n\nThe EU's exploration of these ideas suggests that true balance is not found in the extreme adherence to the Light or the Dark but in the fusion of both. It is a concept that invites fans to reconsider what it means to be truly in harmony with the Force, proposing a middle path that transcends the age-old conflict.", "sampled_crit": 2.4689502716064453}, {"original": "Magic is discovered and it's channeled with music.

The line between your thoughts and theirs blurs, and you find yourself sinking into an abyss of alien fears and unknown dreams.\n\nLeave your story, leave your comment.
