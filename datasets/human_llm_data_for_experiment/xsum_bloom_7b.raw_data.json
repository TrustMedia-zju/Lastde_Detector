        "Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey. About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production. Their concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC. The questionnaire was sent to members of the British Leafy Salad Association and British Summer Fruits, which represent 90% of growers in their sector. There was a big response. Three-quarters of growers completed the survey, which was carried out between 16 May and",

He was speaking in Lima, Peru, where negotiators from 194 countries are heading into a second week of UN talks. They hope to agree a text that would form the basis of new global compact, to be signed in Paris next year. Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon. According to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format. \"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said. \"That, in my view, is a serious mistake. The sanctions available under the Kyoto Protocol, for example, were notionally legally-binding but were simply not credible and failed to guarantee domestic implementation of commitments.\" In",

        "In two famous - and famously lengthy - experiments, scientists wait for pitch to drip from a funnel. It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed. Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up. The invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama. But alongside the storytelling, Dr Kostya Trachenko is adamant there are important measurements to be made. He and his undergraduate students at Queen Mary University of London put their pitch into five different funnels, with different sized openings. Pitch, or bitumen, is the black muck left over from distilling crude oil, and can also be produced by heating wood. It is a liquid",

If central government funding is limited, they argue, the alternative is private finance. Jim Mackey who heads the financial regulator NHS Improvement, along with other health service officials, has had discussions with private financial institutions. My understanding is that they are at the conservative end of the spectrum, for example pension funds, rather than the racier speculators seen in dramas like \"Billions\".

It introduces \"opt out\" actions where everyone affected is automatically a member of the \"class\" which is suing. Consumer groups say it is a huge step forward in helping secure compensation. Previously, when groups of consumers or small and medium-sized businesses wanted to take action against companies who fixed the price of goods or services, on - for example - replica football shirts or air fares, it was very difficult. All of those affected had ether had to \"opt in\" to the action or bring a claim in their own name. As individual losses were small and legal costs and risks high, few did.

The Met says overall crime levels will be unaffected. But fewer than half of Londoners say they will feel safe on the Night Tube. A report by the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee reveals TfL believes anti-social behaviour will rise on the all-night service, causing \"high crime levels\" and a \"rowdy environment\". The BTP has identified 12 \"red\" stations where a special policing plan will be put in place: Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross, Leicester Square, Victoria, Oxford Circus, Waterloo, Vauxhall, London Bridge, Camden Town, North Greenwich, Brixton and Hammersmith. Illegal taxi touting is expected to increase at the end of Tube lines. However, police believe some crime will effectively be displaced from night buses to the Tube. \"Despite these concerns, BTP is confident that robust analysis has been carried out to ensure the Tube remains safe for passengers and staff, but it will be difficult to be sure until it",

Nick got the job against heavy odds. Last year, the company's training schemes had 10,000 applicants for 500 places. Despite a 2:1 degree, his A-level grades ruled him out of most top accountancy companies. Most still require at least the equivalent of three Bs at A-level before they will even consider applicants for trainee posts, either at school-leaver or graduate level. Nick's A-level grades were a B and two Cs. Since 2013, Grant Thornton has relied instead on a series of timed online tests and interviews to whittle the applicants down to a shortlist of about 800 for a final interview. Applicants are scored on their personal and professional achievements, exam grades and on whether recruiters think they would suit the company's culture. \"We regard ourselves",

In May 2011 he had to cope with the fall-out in Pakistan of the killing by US special forces of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad.

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money provided either by the member states themselves or by the European Stability Mechanism, an official EU agency",
        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year.",

After beating Leinster in last May's Pro12 final to round off a stunning 2015-16 campaign, Pat Lam's Connacht side got off to a dreadful start this season as home hammerings by Glasgow and the Ospreys were followed by a further 17-8 defeat by the Dragons. It could have been even worse for the champions as they looked set for a shock defeat by Zebre in Italy on 17 September before torrential rain led to the abandonment of the game. However, Connacht moved off the bottom of the table last weekend thanks to a 28-15 bonus-point win over fellow strugglers Edinburgh and Wilson expects Lam's squad to be fired up for Friday's contest against the Pro12 leaders.

For the third week in a row, the Warburton brothers have lined up at tighthead, with Matt also being named captain for the first time. Warburton's performances during the Lions tour of Southern Africa, however, caused the question to be raised as to whether he will return to play at tighthead for the England XV. On 19 April he was recalled by Graham Henry, who said the Warburton brothers and England's other tighthead, James McManus, were his first-choice choices. The Lions tour, however, saw the debut of Dan O'Donnell, who replaced McManus. On the return leg, Matt Warburton became England's No. 1 tighthead, an honour he retained against Scotland on 5 May.

The subsidy is called the Feed-in Tariff and applies to renewable sources of energy, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and hydro. Basically it's an electricity-only subsidy, which means it's not possible to use the subsidy to finance any gas-fired electricity plants.

        "The SNP's Mhairi Black said extra help should be directed towards women \"shafted and short-changed\" by state pension increases - and her stance was picked up by the Scottish Conservative, Alex Salmond, who will present his plans on Monday.\nThe SNP's socialist MP Annabelle Rudd said the extra \u00a316.60 for women pensioners would be the \"socialist equivalent of a \u00a310 bottle of wine\".\nBut the Labour MP for East Dunbartonshire, Mary Behan, said she could see how the increased pension rate could be helpful for older people in poorer households to allow them to stay in their own homes for longer.\nIn addition to the \u00a316.60 increase, pensions up to \u00a3125 a month would rise by 0.5% this year, to keep them in line with the rate of inflation in 2010/11. Pensions of more than \u00a3125 will be raised by the extra 0.5%.\nThe plans were announced last week after the O",

        "Back-row Cornell du Preez, who touched down twice last Friday against Grenoble, scored again for the Scots. In typical fashion, Edinburgh's pack was able to force several turnovers away from Toulouse's 22m line, but lacked the composure needed to capitalise on them. But the Scots went ahead with the help of another penalty that was converted by centre Daniel Nicoll back in November against Grenoble.\nToulouse's line-up was a case of adding quality to depth against Glasgow with the return of winger Julien Labardelle after sidelined injury. The Frenchman had played a huge part in Toulouse's success in the first half of the season, but had not been fully fit to play the full two days of this weekend's game or against Lyon on Monday night before the French Cup semi-final first leg.\nCentre Baptiste Genton, who scored a huge try in the first half against Grenoble, was injured in this game but manager Guy Nov\u00e8s has said that the Scot will",
        "That is not a surprise because Benitez is managing the same players as his predecessor Steve McClaren, so they are going to have the same issues. I also believe that he is missing those key players who are on the squad, he should have brought in some of them instead but the problem with that is that it will take time to recover but I also hope that the players he bring in help to improve the squad, which is now lacking many players.\nBenitez doesn\u2019t have any magic wand. I do agree with the majority of what you\u2019re saying in this article. I don\u2019t think there is a lot that is going to change under Benitez. I\u2019m sure the board and management team are getting a few things to work in favor of the club going forward. I just personally don\u2019t think there is a lot that is going to change with a different manager.\nI would just say a little bit about the way I follow the club. I look at our current squad as a bit of a project as for us",
        "Northern Irishman McIlroy, 26, has dropped to three in the rankings behind Jordan Spieth and Jason Day but the margin between them has narrowed to nine. McIlroy has a one-shot lead over Spieth and is ahead of the American by five strokes. After a disappointing finish at the PGA National Championship, McIlroy is in great form in the Northern Ireland HSBC Trophy. The three-time European Tour winner had a stellar opening to the HSBC British Open with seven birdies in his first two rounds at Royal Birkdale. A second shot on the opening hole was just his second hole-in-one of the tournament. McIlroy will play Justin Thomas in the final round of the Northern Ireland HSBC Trophy. And his fellow Northern Irishman, Rory McIlroy, went on to win the opening three tournaments of the season. The 22-year-old had a breakout season on the European Tour and finished in the top",
        "However, the EU advocate general said other benefits would be justified if an EU migrant was genuinely seeking work during that period and could prove it. Germany, Austria and Sweden have opposed an EU plan to allow migrants to remain in their countries over two years and study part-time by demanding an opt-out right to migrate to an EU country which allows such a choice. They would allow the migrants to stay and only leave if they applied for a visa when needed.\n\"By extending the maximum stay from six months to 12 months and introducing the option of choosing the country to stay in, the Commission proposal does not alter the fundamental structure of the directive, which offers flexibility to Member States for practical reasons,\" said the advocate general.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on March 11, 2017, with the headline 'EU advocate general opposes right to work permits for migrants'.

But I can\u2019t \u2014 for my son.\nTrista was a senior at her high school and we had spoken before, while she looked on. We both knew \u2014 more or less \u2014 that she was going to be a leader at her school and in her community.

        "The consumers - the voters - appear to be shrugging off the uncertainties, the unknowns and the warnings of future risks. Many economists had predicted a negative impact from the Coronavirus pandemic on the economy in general.\nWe had predicted that the GDP of the US would not grow - like ever - above its all time low of 5% (even though it would get better as the economy recovered) and predicted that the global economy would sink further (we would have been wrong again!).\nA recent article on Bloomberg, the financial news site we love (one of our favorite news sites - we read it every day), called out economists' predictions regarding the impact on the economy caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. These predictions have not come to pass, and in fact, the economy has continued to grow.\nIf you have not seen the previous Forbes article yet, please do.
