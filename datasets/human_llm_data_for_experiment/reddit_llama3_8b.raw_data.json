ELI5 version: Virus good at hiding, spreads easily, hard to get rid of. Long version: The virus has been around since like written history (or so historians say, there's writings of people exhibiting similar symptoms but it wasn't exactly called rabies then). Bats are huge carriers and a big reason why we cant irradicate in the US, but the UK has done a fairly good job at it and a few other areas I believe? Their teeth are also so small, they don't always leave marks. You get bit or scratched by a carrier and even there's been inhalation of vapors from bat feces apparently that causes initial exposure. It's an effective virus in that it can be very slow moving as it travels up the nervous system",

        "Why do we feel hungry, weak, or lightheaded at all, when the body can just burn the stored fat? If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise. But, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still (making you cold/weak/tired) - it might do both, but the homeostasis process is just trying to guard your energy stores. If the food is convincingly unavailable, burning fat to make",
        "Why does our body start deteriorating once we grow old? Why can't our cells just newly replicate themselves again? Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer. However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure. The narrowing can also affect the electrical activity causing the heart to become more prone to arrhythmia. If a coronary artery is completely blocked, that is a heart attack. If there is",

        "about boiling water for births It is very much a thing that is/was helpful for a short period of time -- when home births predominated but were attended by medical professionals who knew about sterilizing equipment, which you can see in the UK in the early seasons of Call the Midwife. They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment might possibly be a) known and b) useful. Otherwise it's a trope used for humor, and fair enough!

Carbs are what diabetics count, not actual sugar. That's why sugar free candy will raise your blood sugar, because they have carbs. Often like 2/3 the amount of carbs of normal sugar candy so those candies arent safe either. They keytones are what kills us when we neglect our blood sugar, they turn our blood acid and shut down our kidneys. When we are hyperglycemic we burn exclusively fat and produce way more keytones than our bodies can handle, leading to diabetic keto acidosis. This is what I was in in the above example.

        "Why are there no green mammals? Firstly, there is a green mammal. The sloth. They are generally covered with a layer of algae that does help them blend in. Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration. In some unique cases you do have blues, but this is not pigment but structural actually. The structure of the surface traps non blue light and lets blue light out. This is how baboons and",
        "Why does salt make everything taste better? Why do humans like it? Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain wrong. Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed. If it's too \"quiet\", not enough of the food to taste, or it's bland, we may not taste something if it never reaches the threshold. So what does this have to do with salt? Some neuron cells have what are called gated channels",
        "Why do men have bigger feet in contrast to women? Why aren't their average foot sizes equal? An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. Women's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a shorter gait and wider hips. This contributes to more efficient walking, standing, and less wear and effort expended on joints and muscles in the legs. Women's feet are more efficient under low",

        "When someone gets pregnant while on birth control and then continues taking it daily until realizing they are pregnant, how does this not harm the fetus? Are there notable side effects from this? Birth control are synthetic *Progestins* AKA Progestogens that trick the body into thinking it's already pregnant. Normally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. Progestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it. It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. Progestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant. The point of this is essentially push pause on the normal ovulation cycle while the fetus is developing, so you don't end up with a second, concurrent fetus several months later. That would mean labor would not",

        "How come dinosaurs like the titanosaur grow to such large size, when animals like the elephant cant grow larger due to the square cube law? The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work. The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work. The square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume grows faster (cubically) than surface (squarly), which also (usually) means that mass will grow faster than the support structure for that mass. An elephants weight is supported by its bones, muscles etc. If you scaled it up the",

As it happens, several of my friends run high-end cheese shops in Paris and I've had the chance to visit their installations and ask questions over the years, and OP's question was one of the first ones I though of, as it's a natural one. Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference. This is why you can take a non-mature goat cheese, say a Crottin de Chavignol, and finish it several different ways to produce",
        "Why are Animals able to gorge themselves with days worth of food, but Humans can't. The notion of \"apex\" predator\" is flawed in a lot of scenarios regarding animals. Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators. This rarely happens because rarely there is an animal that is able to localize and identify such vulnerable individuals to exploit and do opportunistic predation, as well as the risk of injuries. When an animal have higher sociality and engages in more complex cooperative hunting, the ability to handle the stress of large meals is unneeded because the pack with a high success rate for",

Cocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors.

Harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-splicing system is completely changing the outlook for this type of sickness. CRISPR-Cas9 is an immune system for bacteria. It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body. CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to remove a genetic disease (sickle-cell anemia) from patients, using a custom-designed one-time serum that the doctors injected into the patient. It's a little more complicated than that, but CRISPR is the core of that method. Retroviruses, like HIV, are insidious because they splice themselves into your body's cells and become part of you.",

In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the brain.

Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently.

The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra",

The skin is another way for the body to get rid of toxicity in the body just like the liver and kidneys do. When their efforts are not sufficient even in a 24 hr day then smelly toxic products will be sweated out through the skin throughout the 24 hr day no matter what a person does regarding activity. This drastically changes a person\u2019s personal body odor to that of a stinky old person odor. Often older people will say they have not done anything so they don\u2019t need to bath or shower. Yet they do for this very reason. It is no longer just the armpits, now they release smells all over and need to be",

And there is a flight surgeon for every expedition who monitor each crew members health. Usually the flight surgeon is located on the ground but sometimes one of the crew members is a trained medical doctor and can perform the role of flight surgeon from space. There are quite a well stacked medical cabinets on the space station with various drugs and devices that might be needed. You also have to remember that the ISS is a flying research laboratory where they often do biological and medical research. And the astronauts have a lot of first aid training, a lot of them from before even joining the astronaut corps. So the space station is far from the worst place to have a medical issue. As for acute onset problems they will receive first aid by the other astronauts and the flight surgeon. If they find out the condition can not be treated in flight",

Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva. You know that feeling of your mouth watering when you look at/smell something delicious? That's the first stage of digestion preparing itself for the work ahead. If you want to check saliva amylasis in action, try a piece of something you wouldn't consider sweet, but contains",

Babies are born with systems that help them learn language. One of these is Universal Grammar. Universal Grammar is the idea that all languages share the same grammar basics, and everyone (apart from those with extreme language disabilities) is born knowing those basics. This is a widely accepted theory from the famous linguist Noam Chomsky. However, the system has to be \u201cpowered on\u201d. Babies need exposure to language in order to actually develop language. They \u201cknow\u201d the basics, and, in their early years, babies are immersed in one or more languages. This way they learn vocabulary, and they \u201ctweak\u201d the Universal Grammar concepts they know to the languages they hear around them. Parents correcting mistakes doesn\u2019t really mean anything. There have been studies done that show that young children don\u2019t really benefit much from corrections.

Given the 5% body weight you say is necessary to occlude a skin capillary (at what blood pressure, by the way, since blood pressure would have a large impact on that), it seems unlikely that simple shifts in stance (eg swaying) would be significant enough to reduce occlusion pressure below critical opening pressure of the capillaries. So why don't the tissues of the sole of the feet become rapidly damaged in people who stand all day? 15 minutes of ischemia is enough to cause cell death, so people who spend hours standing in one place (such as grocery store clerks) should be experiencing numerous lesions on the sole of their foot, no?

Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral accumulation on the surface, it's usually lymph nodes swelling in response to chemicals released by the infection as your body takes action to fight the infection. - if it does kill anything it will be surface level membranes and cells. - the alcohol needs to be pretty strong and it still needs time to take effect. - just about anything can kill bacteria and viruses pretty easily.... When it's not in your body. You can kill cancer cells in a petri dish with a gun, to narrate the xkcd comic. The problem is that you want the patient to survive.

Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that\u2019s strong enough to allow for incredibly complex chemistry and yet won\u2019t dissolve the molecules that make up the organism. If life is carbon-based, water\u2019s really the only solvent that fits the bill. And while it\u2019s technically possible that there could be life that\u2019s not carbon-based, it\u2019s probably unlikely. This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y\u2019know, live. The way carbon forms strong covalent bonds with itself means it can form molecules like DNA in a way that other atoms just can\u2019t. And even the few elements that can, like silicon, don\u2019t form long chains that are anything like as strong or as stable as carbon\u2019s molecules.

We also know now that the fever isn\u2019t needed for most infections. Your body also has an extremely complex immune system. Fever is part of the primitive response. Primitive response reacts first while the more complex processes ramp up. Macrophages start devouring viruses and bacteria and present pieces of them to T cells. T cells then bind to plasma cells when ramp up their production. It also provides the plasma cell the information it needs to produce antibodies.

Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with. A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during. Spiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses. Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first. That's not to say spiders can't learn, or that they are all the same. Spiders can learn and have",

A tricky monster that breathed a foul breath spreading an invisible sickness that afflicted entire households and sometimes took whole villages. We call it Cholera today, and the 1862 outbreak in Edo killed hundreds of thousands. It was brought entirely due to contact with traders from the west. But of course it didn't have the same total devastation effect that was seen in the Americas and there are a number of reasons for this. Native Americans were uniquely susceptible to diseases from Eurasia because their immune systems were primed differently than Eurasian people's. Specifically, when your immune system is developing your body can specialise in creating cells which are either extremely effective against microbes / infectious diseases, or against parasites like hookworms and tapeworms etc. Native American immune systems were heavily primed against parasites,",

Modern combat keeps the keying of the person within one key and for all combatants the designation of the friendly is the key of C and associated and the enemy to be determined lurks outside of C. The egress point from C to the enemy in B is the resolvation G from a one or two bar of C. The common way to do this yields that people are fatter and taller especially, as the method yields octave resolvation which ultimately expand the keying of the person on a time basis towards being quite tall and weighty towards the end of the phase, and especially smaller at the beginning of the phase as the method starts with a single squad member, C2 or",

        "is it actually a lot worse to mouth breathe and why is it so bad? I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK airways that I've been working on for a few years. I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander. When you mouth breathe, your tongue is down and you're not wearing your bio-appliance. Over",

It's better for those oxygen atoms than being by themselves, but they *really* want some extra electrons, and are basically fighting to gain possession of the other atom's. There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it. One big strong oxygen can take care of a single molecular hydrogen too. Its a pretty great set up for both of them. So when molecular hydrogen and oxygen get to hanging out, it tends to be pretty explosive. Molecular hydrogen, however, is pretty rare here on earth--its often tied up with either a happy oxygen, or another element.

No hospital I\u2019ve been at has detached cribs for healthy newborns, they all have co sleeping beds. You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. Secondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%). Nearly all SIDS cases present with at least one of the above risk factors, excluding bed-sharing.

And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of the fluid.

In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination).

They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't stop, which will eventually make you stop breathing because the muscles can't coordinate.

And why you shouldn\u2019t try to breathe in while drinking liquids (like drinking while heavy panting after exercise or thinking water will help while choking\u2026) When you either accidentally override the automatic muscle closures or are too incapacitated to close those muscles properly anymore you get what\u2019s called \u201caspiration\u201d.

        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic. This means your kidneys need to kick into overdrive and filter out the salty blood as",

It's important to understand that fluoride already occurs naturally in many sources of drinking water. In fact, in some places, the natural mineral water contains significantly *more* fluoride than is recommended to reduce tooth decay, and the excess is removed. Basically, the recommended levels of fluoridation are known to be generally beneficial, and are known not to be harmful, and are well within the bounds of what might be found in nature anyway, and the fluoride is cheap and fluoridation is easy.

There are multiple factors involved in this, but it comes down to neurotransmitter deficits, particularly your GABA system, and something called glutamate rebound. Searching for alcohol, gaba, and glutamate on YouTube will probably find a better video than I could explain. In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you\u2019re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good. Over time, the problem is that the body stops producing that which it is having supplemented, so, if your neurotransmitters were already out of balance, then the alcohol makes it worse by giving your body another source of making this happen, so",

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful molecules, for example, converting Tyramine (found in",

The seat pushes on your back, the muscles in your back push on some of your organs and those organs push on other organs. That's why you feel the ride with your entire body. Everything inside is being pushed around. Normally, all the parts of your body are pushing on each other because of the constant force of gravity. But in the \"free-fall\" state of plummeting down a hill, there is hardly any net force acting on you. In this case, the various pieces of your body are not pushing on each other as much.

(Like dentist office billboard advertisement levels of white teeth) Stains aren't the same thing as plaque or dirt. Staining is in the tooth like dye on cloth, not on the tooth like paint on a wall. One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel. Teeth need to be whitened with something that can oxygenate the enamel and allow the bleaching effect to take place.

If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones.

        "if you get an injury underwater (say in the ocean) that opens the skin and bleeds, what stops your body from intaking water? Your blood pressure is higher than the water pressure. That's basically the short version. When a hole between two liquid containers is made, effectively connecting them, the liquid flowing through that hole will be from the higher pressure container to the lower pressure container. In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container. Incidentally this effect is also behind why when the city water supply has been shut off for a while, then turned back on, the water always comes out of your faucet a bit discolored (yellow or brown) until you let it run for a while. And you're usually told not to drink it until you've left it on for a while to flush water through the system. There are always leaks in a city's main water pipes at the joins where they turn corners or split in two. It can't be helped. But",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose. Notice how this system doesn't leave any room for simple excretion of the excess. To add",
        "Why is death irreversible? Your tissue is made of cells, which are basically tiny living things. When they die, the things they are made out of start breaking down. That's why the body decomposes. It starts with just some chemical bonds breaking. But also any bacteria that was trying to get in your body stops being impeded by your immune system. So that starts moving in and breaking things down too, leaving behind toxins. We can certainly use machines to make the heart beat and lungs move. That will get your circulatory system running. Through this alone we can keep a person \"alive\" long after brain death. Brain death is the one we can't reverse. Your brain is what keeps things going subconsciously, and it's also what gives you your conscious mind. We don't have a way to kickstart that again because we still know basically nothing about how it works. It's kind of like the heart/lungs are a",
        "Why do humans have to \"learn\" to swim? I don't think this is very true. Dogs, cats, and a lot of other land animals are able to swim. Most of them suck at it compared to animals that live in the water. Humans don't have an \"optional swimming feature\". We instinctively know how to do a very laborious paddle. When people \"learn to swim\" it has to do with training them to be better at it. For example, the body is (usually) naturally buoyant, but if you position yourself certain ways in water you still sink. So you learn things like how to float on your back or how to do a backstroke, which is extremely low-energy. Then you learn specific strokes that help you move faster or use less energy. But a completely untrained person is pretty likely to exhaust themselves and drown in a very short time, mostly because biologically speaking we're not made to live in water",

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, compared to other developed countries, has a substantially higher infant mortality rate.

They are arbitrary lines drawn around perceived differences that have been reinforced via social structures. There is little to no genetic, physiological, or physical differentiation between different ethnicities or races that does not partially rely also on social classifications. Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\". Second, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone.

The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color.

The main hazardous characteristic of it is that when it becomes *fryable* the fibers tend to break into shards that have a weird physical structure that results in the ends of the fragments to have curled, hook-like ends that resemble microscopic velcro. The hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively.

When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy.

You can't clean a person like you can a piece of metal. You can clean 99.9% of the oil off a piece of metal and it is as you would expect, almost entirely free of oil. Skin doesn't work like that. Human skin is filled with glands that produce oil constantly to keep our skin healthy; remember that we are basically bags of slightly salty water, we need a waterproof covering to keep the inside in and the outside out. Furthermore our skin grows from an underlying layer pushing the old layers outward. Your surface skin is dead tissue that gradually abrades away. If you brush against something you are losing small amounts of dead cells, not living tissue. Remember that living tissue requires blood to reach every cell, so if your surface",
        "why do babies sit with perfect posture when they learn to sit, but the older you get, the worse it gets? It\u2019s actually because of 2 reasons. They are also kind of interlinked. - firstly babies have very large heads (relatively) and they have a straight spine (that gets bent in and out as we age - which is normal). Having a large and heavy head and a weak neck will make it very hard to hold the head anywhere other than straight over the rest of the body. You can try wearing a heavy helmet and you\u2019ll see that slouching to look at your phone becomes extremely difficult. - this brings us to the second reason. That is modern society habits.

This is not natural and this can cause you to just get used to this slouched position. Some muscles become",

I mean, it only takes a few minutes a day. Regular cleanings, x-rays, and dental checkups are important, but for at least some people, probably not a strict requirement for reasonable dental health if they brush and floss. Remember, a lot of people in the world don't have *any* access to dental care whatsoever, and their teeth are still probably in better shape than the teeth of a prehistoric person. But more to your point, you kind of answered your question in your question. As you correctly pointed out. part of it is that we live a lot longer on average now than we used to.

        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet) for at least 3",

        "if a person was able to free dive to the bottom of the ocean, they would reach a point where the crushing pressure would cause them to simply implode. How is it that the pressure that would kill a human has no effect on the fish well past that depth? Why do we get squished and they don\u2019t? Most of the highly upvoted comments here are wrong. The premise of the question is wrong. If you dove to the bottom of the ocean you would not implode. As the pressure rises, the air-filled spaces in your body would get smaller. Your lungs would shrink down, so your ribs would move inward like they do when you exhale. Your sinuses and inner ears would fill with water. But that\u2019s it. Most of your body is incompressible liquids and solids, which will not get smaller under pressure, so they will not move. *Physically*, a human sent to the ocean floor will look just fine.

        "How do people actually die from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease? Most deaths are from Alzheimers patients not being able to take care of themselves and having to go to nursing homes. They die from infections and other things that they can\u2019t take care of themselves. People die from Alzheimer\u2019s disease because their brain cells are dying. There are two types of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Early Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Late Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Early Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease is when people under the age of 65 get Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Late Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease is when people over the age of 65 get Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.

I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good explanation, but I can\u2019t find it.\nThe hip is a ball-and-socket joint. The ball is the femoral head, which is the ball-shaped end of the femur. The socket is the acetabulum, which is the cup-shaped end of the hip bone. The femoral head and acetabulum are covered in cartilage, which is a slippery material that allows the hip to move smoothly.

        "Why the elderly body odor is so strong? As a person ages the body naturally slows down. This includes all parts of the body. Whereas a young person may be able to go for a run and then jump into the shower, an elderly person may need to take a break after a walk and then shower. This is because the body\u2019s ability to process waste slows down as we age. The result is that the body\u2019s ability to remove odor-causing bacteria is also reduced. This is why the elderly body odor is so strong.\nWhat causes body odor?\nBody odor is caused by the bacteria that live on our skin. These bacteria feed on the sweat that we produce and produce a smell that is unique to each person. The amount of sweat we produce is determined by our genetics and our environment. If we are hot and sweaty, we will produce more sweat and therefore more body odor. If we are cold and dry, we will produce less sweat and therefore less body odor. The type of",

        "Why does blood sugar spike after a meal if food is digested in the stomach for several hours before it starts getting absorbed in the small intestine? Shouldn\u2019t the blood sugar start spiking after the food enters the small intestine?\nBlood sugar spikes after a meal because the food you eat is digested in the stomach and then absorbed in the small intestine. This process takes a few hours, but the blood sugar still spikes after the food enters the small intestine.\nThe reason for this is that the food is not digested in the stomach, but rather in the small intestine. The small intestine is where the majority of digestion takes place. When food enters the small intestine, it is broken down into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. These molecules include glucose, which is the main source of energy for the body.\nWhen these molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream, they cause a spike in blood sugar levels. This is why blood sugar spikes after a meal, even if the food has been",

        "why do we get sweaty palms if we're doing something dangerous like climbing? Isn't that counter-productive? Similarly, it bothers me when people get nervous and start to sweat. I know it's the body's way of cooling us down, but it doesn't seem like a very efficient way of doing it. Wouldn't it be better to sweat all over, not just on the palms and armpits? And what about people who have a condition where they can't sweat? Don't they get overheated? (I'm sure there's a medical term for that, but I can't think of it.)\nIn my opinion, the reason we get sweaty palms is because we're nervous. When we're nervous, we're more likely to make mistakes, and sweaty palms make it more difficult to grip things. So it's a way of saying, \"I'm nervous, so don't trust me with anything.\" As for sweating all over, I think it's just a matter of",
        "How does an alcohol overdose kill you? Hi there. simply put, you have two chemicals that either speed your brain and body up, or slow it down. The first one is dopamine. This is the chemical that makes you feel good, and you have more of it when you are drunk. When you drink too much, the dopamine is released into your blood stream and it goes into your brain, where it causes your brain to speed up. The second chemical is called serotonin. This is the chemical that makes you feel calm, and when you drink too much, the serotonin is released into your blood stream and it goes into your brain, where it causes your brain to slow down. The combination of the two chemicals can cause your brain to speed up and slow down at the same time, which can cause your brain to overheat and die. So if you drink too much alcohol, it can kill you.\nHow does an alcohol overdose kill you? Hi there. simply put, you have two",
        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. The theory of medicine was that disease was caused by an imbalance of the four humours of the body: black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood. A person was considered to be in good health when these four humours were in balance. The theory was that when a person was ill, one or more of the humours was out of balance. To cure the disease, the doctor would have to bring the body back into balance. To do this, the doctor would let out the humour that was out of balance. If the patient had a fever, the doctor would let out blood to reduce the heat in the body. If the patient was too cold, the doctor would let out blood to increase the heat in the body. The doctor would also let out blood to reduce the amount of phlegm in the body",

The answers so far are not satisfactory.\nThe human body has an amazing ability to adapt to changes in its environment.

But how does the body know to stop producing blood cells in the affected limb? The answer is not yet known.\nThere are many theories about how the body knows to stop producing blood cells in the affected limb.

        "Why does alcohol make stress and depression \"go away\" almost instantly but is making it worse in the long run? There are multiple factors involved in this phenomenon. First, alcohol is a depressant and it causes a sedative effect on the central nervous system. When you drink alcohol, you are actually decreasing your level of anxiety. This is because alcohol acts as a depressant and causes your body to produce less dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate your mood. This is why alcohol can make you feel more relaxed and less anxious.\nHowever, when you drink alcohol regularly, your body becomes accustomed to it. Your body will start to produce more dopamine in order to compensate for the decrease in dopamine caused by the alcohol. This means that you will start to feel more anxious and stressed when you don't drink alcohol.\nAnother factor that contributes to this phenomenon is the fact that alcohol can cause a temporary increase in serotonin levels. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating mood and",

The active ingredient in grapefruit is called bergapten. It is a natural compound that is found in citrus fruits. Bergapten inhibits the action of an enzyme in the liver called CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of a large number of medications. When CYP3A4 is inhibited, the drugs are not metabolized properly. This can lead to an increase in the amount of the drug in the blood. This can cause an increase in the side effects of the drug. It can also cause the drug to build up in the body.

So a good bit of answers here but I'll try to summarize: The HIV virus has a high mutation rate and there are millions of copies of the virus in the body. So, if you have a drug that can kill a certain percentage of the virus, it's only a matter of time before the virus mutates and becomes resistant to that drug. So, we have to take multiple drugs at the same time to have a chance of keeping the virus under control. The virus is still in the body but the drugs keep it at a low level. The problem is that the virus can still hide in the body and cause problems.

These are generic patrolling cells that are always on the lookout for viruses. These cells are able to recognize the virus because they have certain proteins that bind to the virus. Once the virus is recognized by the innate immune system, the virus is tagged as a foreign invader and the cells start to produce a protein called interferon. Interferon is a signaling molecule that tells the cells in the body to start producing a protein called Mx. Mx is a protein that can bind to the virus and block the replication of the virus.

However, tobacco is not just tobacco, it\u2019s a plant that\u2019s been bred for thousands of years to be as addictive as possible. This is done by adding nicotine to the plant. Nicotine is a naturally occurring chemical that\u2019s found in tobacco. It\u2019s also found in other plants, but not in the same quantities as in tobacco.\nNicotine is a very addictive chemical, and it\u2019s the reason why people smoke. The nicotine in tobacco is what makes it addictive. It\u2019s also what makes it so harmful.

        "How do apes like chimps and gorillas have extraordinary strength, and are well muscled all year round - while humans need to constantly work out to build muscles?\nApe muscles are made up of more fast-twitch fibers than humans. This means they can exert more force and power in short bursts, but can't sustain it for as long. Humans, on the other hand, have more slow-twitch fibers, which allow them to sustain muscle activity for a longer period of time.\nHowever, humans are better at endurance than apes, and apes are better at strength. The reason for this is that apes have more fast-twitch fibers, which allows them to generate more force in a shorter period of time. This is why they can lift heavy objects and climb trees with ease. However, humans have more slow-twitch fibers, which allows them to sustain muscle activity for a longer period of time. This is why humans can run marathons and swim for hours",
        "When you go to sleep weighing a certain amount and wake up weighing less. Where did that weight go? There are several sources. Here the are:\nWater Weight\nWater weight is the amount of water your body holds onto. This can be caused by a variety of things. For example, if you are dehydrated your body will hold onto water. If you eat too much salt your body will hold onto water to help flush out the salt. If you are eating a lot of carbs your body will hold onto water to help break down the carbs. Water weight is the easiest to lose. If you drink more water you will lose water weight. If you eat less carbs and salt you will lose water weight. If you are dehydrated and drink more water you will lose water weight.\nMuscle Weight\nMuscle weight is the amount of muscle you have. When you lose weight you will lose some muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat. You will lose more muscle weight than fat weight",

The placebo effect is just a way to trick the brain into thinking it's doing something, when it's actually doing it on its own.\nThe placebo effect is a phenomenon in which a person's perception of a treatment is more important than the actual treatment itself. This means that the brain is able to trick itself into thinking it's receiving a treatment, even when it's not. This can be a powerful tool in medicine, as it can help people feel better without actually giving them a treatment. However, it's important to remember that the placebo effect is not a cure-all, and it's not always effective.",

        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why the body stores fat is to understand the history of our species. Our bodies were designed for a time when food was scarce, and famine was a constant threat. So our bodies are designed to store fat as a way to survive when food is not available. When food is available, the body will burn fat as a source of energy.

        "Why can't things be sterilized by time? Well, it depends on the pathogen in question. Most viral particles quickly become non-viable and non-infectious in the environment. Bacterial spores, however, can remain viable for a very long time. If you have ever had a can of beans or soup in your pantry for a few years, you may have noticed that the can is rusted and the beans are covered in mold, but the beans are still edible. This is because the mold is growing on the beans, but the mold is not growing inside the beans. The mold cannot penetrate the hard bean shell. So, if you have a can of beans that is three years old, and you open it, the beans are still safe to eat.\nBacterial spores, however, are not contained by a shell.

The problem with humans is that we can't eat whatever is available in our environment. We have to go out and hunt it down or grow it ourselves. This makes us unique. The reason why humans have so many types of food is because we have the ability to produce food that we can't eat naturally. For example, we can grow wheat, which we can't eat naturally. This allows us to have a wider variety of food than other animals. We also have the ability to produce food that other animals can't eat, such as cows and chickens.

Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common complaint among athletes and non-athletes alike. This condition can be painful and may affect the quality of your workouts and your daily life. Fortunately, DOMS can be prevented by following a few simple guidelines.\nThe most common cause of DOMS is the breakdown of muscle tissue. This occurs when you perform a new or unfamiliar exercise, or you perform an exercise using a greater weight than usual. When the muscle tissue is damaged, the body\u2019s repair mechanism kicks in to rebuild the damaged tissue. The soreness you feel is caused by the buildup of lactic acid and other byproducts of muscle repair.

        "How are viruses like the common cold able to continue existing if they are never \"successful\" and are killed off by our species' immune system? In other words, how are they able to evolve? What causes a virus to mutate? If you have any information on this subject, I would appreciate it very much.\nViruses are not alive. They are bits of genetic material that are able to reproduce themselves, but only by hijacking a living cell to do the work for them. The genetic material of the virus is injected into a living cell, and the cell starts making copies of the virus. The virus then bursts out of the cell, killing it, and goes on to infect other cells.\nBecause viruses are not alive, they do not evolve in the same way that living things do. They are not able to adapt to changes in their environment. They can only reproduce and spread if they are able to find a living cell to infect. If they cannot find a living cell, they will",
        "what is the natural way to die? This comes up a lot, and it's often very wrong answers that get upvoted, or at least that's what I've seen. I've seen people say that you should die in your sleep, or that you should die while you're young and healthy. I don't think either of those are true.\nI think the best way to die is to be with your loved ones, and to have your loved ones with you. I think it's important to be able to say goodbye to your loved ones, and to know that they'll be okay without you.

        "Why did humans get stuck with periods while other mammals didn't? It\u2019s because we are always fertile, instead of coming into heat a few times a year.\nIn the past, women were more likely to get pregnant during the fertile days of their menstrual cycle. Now, with the availability of birth control, women are more likely to get pregnant outside of their fertile days. This has led to a decrease in the number of pregnancies.\nThe menstrual cycle is a series of changes that occur in the female reproductive system. The cycle is divided into three phases: menstruation, ovulation, and the luteal phase. Menstruation is the first phase of the cycle, and it occurs when the uterine lining sheds. Ovulation is the second phase of the cycle, and it occurs when an egg is released from the ovary. The luteal phase is the third phase of the cycle, and it occurs when the corpus luteum produces progesterone.\nWhat is the average",
        "Why do babies puke so much? If it is not plausible, no. The main points here is that smooth muscle is not trainable, the stomach is not a muscle, and the stomach does not have a sphincter. The only way to increase the speed of gastric emptying is to increase the speed of the stomach's peristalsis. This is a function of the autonomic nervous system and cannot be trained. I have seen people try to train their stomachs to empty faster by doing various things like drinking a glass of water and then running around like a mad man for a few minutes. The only thing that happens is that the person gets really thirsty. The stomach is not a muscle, it is a hollow organ, and it is not a muscle. If you want to increase the speed of gastric emptying, the only thing you can do is to increase the speed of the stomach's peristalsis. This is a function of the autonomic nervous system and cannot",
        "How can'over-potting' be a thing when plants grow straight from the Earth's surface with infinite amounts of soil available? It\u2019s a plant\u2019s natural instinct to grow in a container. When you over-pot a plant, you are simply providing it with more space than it needs to grow. If you are planting a plant in a container, you are essentially replicating the conditions it would have in the wild. In the wild, plants grow in soil. When you plant a plant in a container, you are giving it soil to grow in. When you over-pot a plant, you are simply giving it more space than it needs to grow. The plant will still grow, but it will be larger than it would have been if you had not over-potted it.\nThe term \u201cover-potting\u201d refers to a situation in which a plant is planted in a container that is too large for the plant. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but the",
        "Why is asbestos so much more dangerous than other'sharp' dusts like fibreglass? JESUS CHRIST. These are the most dangerous words you can hear if you're a construction worker. That's because it's a sign that you've just breathed in asbestos fibres. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was widely used in building materials such as insulation and roofing. It was used because it's fire resistant, strong and doesn't conduct electricity. But it's also a carcinogen, which means it can cause cancer. The problem is that when asbestos fibres are disturbed, they can become airborne and be inhaled. This is where the danger lies. Asbestos fibres are so small that they can get into the lungs and stay there for a long time. This can lead to asbestos-related diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis. So, what can you do to protect yourself from asbestos? The best thing you can do is to",

        "How fast can food pass through the body? To go off on a tangent but still answer OPs question, I don't have a large intestine, but I do have a small intestine. I know that my stomach can hold about 1.5 liters of food and that it takes about 4 hours for food to pass through my stomach. I've heard that the small intestine can hold about 4 liters of food and that it takes about 8 hours for food to pass through it. So, if you have a large intestine, then it would take about 8 hours for food to pass through your small intestine and then another 8 hours for it to pass through your large intestine. So, the total time for food to pass through your body would be about 16 hours. However, I'm not sure if this is accurate because I'm not sure how much food can be held in the large intestine.\nThe average time for food to pass through the body is about 24 hours",

Furthermore, can soap be dirty? >...if I\u2019m always clean when I use them?\nI think it is a question of physics. Soap and water molecules are small and they can get into the pores of your skin. If you don't dry yourself well after you bathe, the soap and water molecules can get into the towel and stay there. It is the same principle that makes you dry faster when you use a towel instead of letting yourself air dry. The towel absorbs the water and the soap molecules and you feel dry. The towel is dirty because it has soap and",

        "Why do teeth require so much effort to maintain? Well that's sort of a subjective point of view, because I would argue that regular brushing and flossing is not much effort at all. In fact, it's a lot easier than most people make it out to be. If you really think about it, how much effort does it take to brush your teeth? Brushing your teeth is probably the easiest thing you do on a daily basis, and flossing isn't much harder. The real issue is that most people don't do it properly, and that's why they have issues with their teeth.\nIf you are going to brush your teeth, you need to do it correctly. If you don't, then you are just wasting your time. I'm not saying that you should brush your teeth for two hours a day, but you need to brush for at least two minutes. That's not a lot of time, and it's not going to be very hard.\nI think",
        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is actually a gas bubble in your tissue. That is what people usually refer to as decompression sickness. It's also called the bends. That's the most common one. It's a gas bubble in the tissue. The other type is called arterial gas embolism. That's a gas bubble in the blood vessels. The way that that happens is when you're diving, you're breathing compressed air. So the air that you're breathing is compressed. So the air that you're breathing is compressed. So it's actually higher pressure than the air that you're breathing at the surface. So when you come up from a dive, you're breathing compressed air. But as you come up, the pressure is decreasing. So the air that you're breathing is becoming less compressed. So the air that you're breathing is becoming less compressed. So",
