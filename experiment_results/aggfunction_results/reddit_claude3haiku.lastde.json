Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed.

The fiber in the orange helps to regulate the body's insulin response, preventing the rapid spike and subsequent crash that can occur when consuming fruit juices.\n\nIn contrast, when you drink orange juice, the natural sugars are extracted from the fruit, leaving behind the fiber. This allows the sugars to be absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream, leading to a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. This can be especially problematic for individuals with diabetes or those trying to manage their blood sugar levels.\n\nAdditionally, many commercial orange juices are often sweetened with added sugars, further exacerbating the issue. The combination of the natural sugars and the added sugars can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate blood sugar, leading to a more significant and prolonged spike.\n\nBy eating an orange, you not only benefit from the fiber content but also the slower release of the natural sugars, which helps to maintain a more stable blood sugar level.

It's not just that there is a lack of saliva production in cotton mouth (also known as xerostomia), but the implications go far beyond that.\n\nSaliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health. It helps neutralize acids, wash away food particles, and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Without adequate saliva, the mouth becomes a breeding ground for these bacteria, leading to an increased risk of tooth decay and gum disease.\n\nIn a dry mouth, the pH balance is disrupted, allowing the bacteria to thrive and produce more acid. This acid can erode the tooth enamel, leading to cavities and sensitivity. Additionally, the lack of saliva can cause the gums to become inflamed and more susceptible to infection, a condition known as gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, a severe form of gum disease that can ultimately lead to tooth loss.\n\nFurthermore, the reduced saliva flow can make it difficult to chew and swallow,", "sampled_crit": -8.15276050567627}, {"original": "If holding bladder is harmful, why isn't it an issue while sleeping?

As a result, the need to urinate during sleep is significantly reduced, allowing you to sleep through the night without the need to get up and use the bathroom.\n\nIn contrast, when you're awake and active, the production of ADH decreases, and the kidneys produce more urine.

Firstly, the male reproductive system is more complex than the female one, making it more difficult to target and disrupt the production or release of sperm. Females have a monthly cycle with a clear ovulation event, whereas males produce sperm continuously, making it harder to find a safe and effective way to interrupt this process.\n\nAdditionally, the potential side effects of male contraceptives have been a significant concern.

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less common citrus fruits can interact with certain medications, causing the drug levels in the body to either increase or decrease. This interaction occurs because these fruits contain compounds called furanocoumarins, which can inhibit the activity of an enzyme called CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing and breaking down many different types of medications, including some commonly prescribed drugs such as statins, certain blood pressure medications, and some antidepressants.\n\nWhen grapefruit or other interacting citrus fruits are consumed, the furanocoumarins can block the CYP3A4 enzyme, leading to higher levels of the medication in the body. This can result in an increased risk of side effects or even toxicity.

These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet and legs that a wild horse would only experience rarely.

In the wild, horses' hooves are naturally worn down by the abrasive surfaces they traverse, such as rocky terrain and hard-packed soil. However, when horses are domesticated and kept in environments with softer, less abrasive footing, their hooves can overgrow and become prone to cracking, chipping, or other issues.\n\nHorseshoes serve to protect the hoof from excessive wear and tear, providing a durable surface that can withstand the demands of domesticated life.

Is it \"just\" because of how we name things?\n\nThe perception of color is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction between the physical properties of light and the way our visual system processes and interprets that information. While yellow is often classified as a primary color, the reason for this classification is not solely due to how we name things, but rather a result of the way our eyes and visual system function.\n\nThe human eye contains two main types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones. The cones are responsible for color vision and are sensitive to three primary colors: red, blue, and green. These three colors are known as the \"trichromatic\" system, and they form the basis for how we perceive color.\n\nHowever, the perception of yellow is not simply a result of how we name things. Yellow is actually a combination of the stimulation of the red and green cones in the eye, which creates the perception of the color yellow.

Firstly, zebras are inherently more aggressive and less docile compared to horses, which made them more challenging to tame and train for domestic purposes. Zebras have a strong survival instinct and a tendency to be unpredictable, making them less suitable for tasks such as transportation, agriculture, or warfare, which were the primary reasons for the domestication of horses in other parts of the world.\n\nAdditionally, the social structure and cultural practices of the indigenous African societies may not have been as conducive to the domestication of zebras as they were for other animals, such as cattle or goats. The lack of a strong tradition of animal husbandry or the absence of a need for large-scale transportation or agricultural work may have reduced the incentive for these societies to invest the time and resources required to domesticate zebras.\n\nMoreover, the ecological conditions of the African", "sampled_crit": -7.328723907470703}, {"original": "Why does the human body jerk/shock itself awake sometimes while trying to sleep?

This thing is called a [hypnic] jerk.\n\nThe phenomenon known as a hypnic jerk, or sleep start, is a common occurrence that happens to many people as they are falling asleep. It is a sudden, involuntary muscle contraction or twitch that can cause the body to jerk or shock itself awake. This sudden movement is believed to be a remnant of an evolutionary reflex that was designed to prevent our ancient ancestors from falling out of trees while sleeping.\n\nThe exact cause of hypnic jerks is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the transition between wakefulness and sleep. As the body begins to relax and the muscles start to lose tone, the brain may misinterpret this as a sign of falling, triggering a sudden muscle contraction to prevent the perceived fall. This sudden jerk can startle the individual and cause them to wake up briefly before falling back asleep.\n\nFactors such as stress, anxiety, caffeine consumption, and sleep deprivation can increase the frequency and intensity of hypnic jerks.
