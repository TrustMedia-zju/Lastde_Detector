{"document":{"0":"Speaking to the BBC, Thomas Thabane said he would return from South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho, \"as soon as I know I am not going to get killed\".\nReports say the capital, Maseru, is now calm after soldiers seized buildings. The army denied staging a coup.\nLesotho has seen a series of military coups since independence in 1966.\nMr Thabane has headed a unity government since elections in May 2012, but suspended parliament sessions in June amid feuding in his coalition.\nHe denied accusations that his actions had undermined his government.\nMr Thabane said the army had rendered the government \"dysfunctional\", an action that amounted to a coup.\n\"I have been removed from control not by the people but by the armed forces, and that is illegal,\" he told the BBC's Newshour programme.\n\"I came into South Africa this morning and I will return as soon as my life is not in danger. I will not go back to Lesotho to get killed.\"\nSouth Africa's government described the situation as \"worrying\", with spokesman Clayson Monyela saying the country would not tolerate \"unconstitutional change of government\".\nAt the scene: Basildon Peta, Maseru, Lesotho\nThis whole thing started around 03:00. There were gunshots since early morning. The city is currently calm. People are playing it safe within their homes, but there is basically a media blackout.\nTo all intents and purposes it is a military coup with the aim of ousting the prime minister. There can be no other reason of soldiers behaving the way they have been behaving other than to seize power.\nSo far we have no reports of killings. It would be correct to call it a bloodless coup attempt. But I am not going to stick around. The chances are the situation may deteriorate. One does not know what is going to happen.\nBasildon Peta is the publisher of the Lesotho Times\nThe army is understood to have acted after the prime minister attempted to remove its chief, Lt Gen Kennedy Tlai Kamoli.\nThe army said the general was still in charge, saying the military \"supports the democratically elected government of the day,\" Reuters news agency reported.\nA spokesman, Maj Ntlele Ntoi, denied staging a coup, saying: \"There is nothing like that, the situation has returned to normalcy... the military has returned to their barracks.\"\nEarlier, troops were seen on the streets of Maseru and there were reports of gunfire.\nRadio stations were taken off air and phone lines were cut, although later reports suggested they were working again.\nSports Minister Thesele Maseribane told the AFP news agency that troops had surrounded State House, a key government building.","1":"The move was confirmed during a backbench debate on the row over Carol Mills' choice as preferred candidate.\nCommons Speaker John Bercow decided recently to pause the process amid MPs' concerns about her suitability.\nMr Straw told MPs that it was \"imperative\" that the future status and remit of the job was agreed upon.\nThe clerk of the House is the principal constitutional adviser to the Commons, and adviser on all its procedure and business.\nPaid \u00c2\u00a3200,000 a year, he or she is also responsible for the overall administration of the House of Commons, including the signing of leases, contracts and public expenditure on Commons services.\nMPs have questioned the selection of Carol Mills - who works in the Australian Parliament - to replace the former Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, who retired in July.\nSpeaking in a debate in the Commons, Jesse Norman - who has led opposition to the appointment - said disquiet over the job raised wider questions about how the Commons governed itself.\n\"This debate arises because of a widespread concern among colleagues across the House that the appointment process for the next clerk of this House was seriously flawed,\" he said.\nMr Norman said the new committee - which will report early next year - would examine the question of whether the procedural and management roles of the Clerk should be divided between different officials.\nMr Bercow, who headed the panel which originally chose Ms Mills but was not in the chair for Wednesday's debate, has said the proposal has merit and should be considered by MPs.\nConfirming his involvement, Mr Straw said the committee would look into the case for separating the roles and how that might work in practice and make a series of recommendations.\nHowever, he expressed concern that the committee was having to complete its work in nine weeks.\nEx-Commons leader Andrew Lansley - who sat on the original selection panel - said he believed the appointment was mistaken and accused Mr Bercow of seeking to \"water down\" the requirement in the job description that the Clerk should have \"detailed knowledge of the procedures and practices of the House\".\nHe said he believed the entire appointment process should be abandoned and a clerk appointed on a temporary basis until the House reached agreement on the future of the role.\nBut Labour MP Barry Sheerman said critics of the appointment had a \"secret agenda\", which amounted to wanting to \"have a go at the Speaker\".\nAnd Tory MP Philip Davies said colleagues of his who were using the row as a \"Trojan Horse for a personal vendetta\" against Mr Bercow looked \"absolutely ridiculous\".\nFor the government, deputy Commons leader Tom Brake said it was \"entirely proper\" for the committee to look into the matter, saying the terms of the review was an issue for MPs, not ministers.\nBut he said it was important that it should be done in a \"timely manner\" and that the public should know which Commons officials were accountable for the \"substantial challenges\" the House faced.","2":"Michal Iwanowksi, 39, from Roath, Cardiff, used a rough map found in his great uncle's diary to follow the perilous route the brothers took through the forests of Russia to safety in Poland in 1945.\nThe epic four month journey saw Anatol and Wiktor Iwanowski flee the camp in Kaluga, elude an ambush which saw two fellow escapees recaptured and Anatol shot in the hand, and survive camping in  minus 20 degrees Celsius as winter tightened its icy grip.\nBattling fever caused by his untreated gunshot wound and without fresh water to drink, Anatol existed only on frozen berries and mushrooms, using just a makeshift compass and the stars to navigate.\nThe brothers were dependant on the cover of night for survival and could not risk being spotted by another living soul as the Russian people were starving and the prize for turning in a fugitive was 16kg (35 lbs) of flour.\nBut despite all odds they were able to rejoin their families in Wroclaw, Poland, as changed men and lived to tell their tale.\nMichal, who moved to Wales 15 years ago, has said he regrets not asking his grandfather more about his escape during his lifetime.\nBut in the summer of 2013, nearly 70 years later, he felt compelled to retrace the brothers' steps, documenting the harsh landscapes through a modern fugitive's eyes, for his new book Clear of People.\nThe trip was made possible by an Arts Council of Wales grant and his book which is being crowd funded is due for publication with an accompanying exhibition this summer.\nHe said: \"Unlike them I couldn't camp as the authorities require an address for each night before allowing you in the country and I was carrying heavy photographic equipment.\n\"I knew it was a pilgrimage I had to take. I felt I owed my grandfather and great uncle this because I never asked questions when I had the chance.\"\nWhile the cities along the route may have changed drastically, the stark rural landscape between them remains almost untouched.\nHis photos capture a world far from the pressures of modern life, where the natural landscape dominates.\nMichal said: \"I walked for hours alone, hearing only the sound of my own footsteps, with my ears tuned in to the finest detail. I totally lost track of time and space.\"\nThe resulting photographs have already been exhibited at Ffotogallery in Cardiff, Sydney, Australia, and Barcelona, Spain.\n\"Making this project is my silent tribute to them and the other people who had to go through journeys like this so that our generation didn't,\" added Michal.\n\"But it's a timeless story about the human spirit rather than a nationalistic exercise.\n\"It's important for the times we live in as more and more people are on the move across the continents, uprooting their lives and fleeing from conflict zones.\n\"This body of work also pays a silent tribute to the past and present fugitive on their quest for safety.\"\nMichal will be talking about his journey at Made Gallery in Roath on Saturday 19 March.","3":"Media

first session, before O'Sullivan hit back to lead 9-8.\nBingham won four in a row to go 12-9 ahead, before clinching the next to set up a semi-final against Judd Trump.\n\"I was way off the pace,\" said O'Sullivan. \"He just pushed me around and I felt second best all match.\"\nBingham revealed he was in tears after the match and described the victory as \"unbelievable\".\n\"Ronnie is the best player in the world, but time is catching up,\" he added. \"I knew I had been playing well.\"\nO'Sullivan was a clear favourite heading into the match, but looked ill-at-ease at times, missing opportunities he would usually have taken.\nHe caused controversy in the fifth frame after placing a chalk on the table to line up a shot, breaking snooker rules, but was not reprimanded by the referee.\nThere have been several incidents at this year's championship involving the 2014 runner-up, including playing in his socks, almost snapping a cue and making an obscene gesture.\nThe pair met at the same stage in 2013, when O'Sullivan ran out a comfortable 13-4 winner, but it was a different story this time.\nBingham, who reaches his first Crucible semi-final in nine attempts, led 6-3 with a sublime 145 break in the second session, equalling the highest of the tournament.\nBut O'Sullivan hit back with three frames on the trot, before the pair went all-square at 8-8.\nBingham, winner of two ranking events, broke down on a maximum 147 effort having pocketed 11 reds and 11 blacks, as he edged two frames away from victory.\nA composed 51 took the world number 10 closer to the winning line, before a 66 break gave him a famous victory.","4":"A bloc of left-wing parliamentarians, of which Sinn F\u00e9in is a member, proposed the measure in Strasbourg.\nThe amendment was defeated by 374 votes to 66.\nSinn F\u00e9in said the outcome was disappointing, but it will continue to campaign for special status.\nSinn F\u00e9in MEP Matt Carthy, who represents the Republic of Ireland's Midlands-North-West constituency said: \"We have already ensured that the European Parliament is in agreement that the Good Friday Agreement should be protected in all its parts.\n\"Moreover, the European Council's negotiation guidelines support the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the need for flexible and imaginative solutions.\n\"We are engaging with hundreds of political representatives and officials  from across Europe in order to gather further support for special status for the north within the EU and will continue to do so,\" he added.\nThe DUP MEP, Diane Dodds, welcomed the vote: \"Since last June, Sinn F\u00e9in and others have made a special designated status their big ticket priority for Brexit.\n\"It is clear that support for this scenario has gained little traction.\n\"The negotiating guidelines published by the European Parliament and Council earlier this year make no reference to a special designated status and both governments in London and Dublin have failed to back the proposal.\n\"Ultimately this week's vote by MEPs is further demonstration that Sinn F\u00e9in's Brexit charm offensive has failed miserably.\n\"Moving forward the DUP will continue to work tirelessly, engaging closely with stakeholders across sectors affected, and using our influence both at Westminster and in Brussels, to ensure that our Province gets the best possible deal from Brexit,\" she added.\nAfter the debate, the Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson criticised Sinn F\u00e9in for using the term \"the north of Ireland\" to refer to Northern Ireland.\nHe said: \"They say they want \"special status\", but they cannot even say the name of the region they want this special status for.\n\"It is clear for all to see that Sinn Fein's concern is not the economic wellbeing of the people of Northern Ireland, rather it is about trying to use the European Parliament as a platform for anti-UK posturing.\" he added.","5":"More than 100 British Transport Police (BTP) officers will patrol the 144 Underground stations open all night to try to \"set behavioural standards\".\nThe Met says overall crime levels will be unaffected.\nBut fewer than half of Londoners say they will feel safe on the Night Tube.\nA report by the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee reveals TfL believes anti-social behaviour will rise on the all-night service, causing \"high crime levels\" and a \"rowdy environment\".\nThe BTP has identified 12 \"red\" stations where a special policing plan will be put in place: Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross, Leicester Square, Victoria, Oxford Circus, Waterloo, Vauxhall, London Bridge, Camden Town, North Greenwich, Brixton and Hammersmith.\nIllegal taxi touting is expected to increase at the end of Tube lines.\nHowever, police believe some crime will effectively be displaced from night buses to the Tube.\n\"Despite these concerns, BTP is confident that robust analysis has been carried out to ensure the Tube remains safe for passengers and staff, but it will be difficult to be sure until it is up and running,\" says the report.\nForty-six percent of Londoners told a recent YouGov poll that they would feel safe taking the Night Tube, with 38% feeling unsafe and 16% unsure.\nAccording to TfL's quarterly safety survey, Londoners are less likely to avoid using public transport because of a fear of crime than they were seven years ago.\nOverall crime on the network has fallen, although reported sexual offences and violence against the person are up.\nBut although 15% had experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on the network, 90% of those did not report it.\nThe BTP told the committee that most of these were \"stealth offences committed in crowds, in crowded tube carriages, frankly, which is sexual touching and horrible behaviour like that\".\nA text messaging reporting service, 61016, was launched last year to encourage people to report unwanted sexual behaviour.\nOn the New York subway, poster messages try to deter offences, but TfL research found that women who had experienced unwanted sexual behaviour did not want to be reminded of it by posters.","6":"That is not a surprise because Benitez is managing the same players as his predecessor Steve McClaren, so they are going to have the same issues.\nThe Spaniard took over on 11 March with the team in the Premier League relegation zone for two basic reasons - they concede too many goals, and they find scoring them very difficult.\nBenitez's task is to make Newcastle more solid, but also increase their creativity and goal threat.\nAt this stage of the season, with so few games left, it will be a big, tough job for him to turn all of that around.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSunday's Tyne-Wear derby draw with Sunderland was a game between two poor teams - one of them looks almost certain to get relegated, and both of them could end up going down.\nNewcastle deserved a point but, for the first hour, I did not think they played particularly well at all. They did improve, and started moving the ball around quicker, but they had to work hard just to get a 1-1 draw from a game they needed to win.\nThe most encouragement I took out of the game was about Magpies striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, and that the bit of confidence he will get from his goal might spur him on to get a few more before the end of the season.\nI am not holding my breath, but that is what I am hoping for.\nSunderland are down at the bottom of the table too because they have their own problems, but one of the things they do have is a finisher.\nAfter scoring their goal at St James' Park, Jermain Defoe now has 12 Premier League goals this season. They have earned his side 11 points, or 42% of their total.\nThat is massive for a struggling side. I interviewed Jermain for The Sun last week and I know how important he is to Black Cats boss Sam Allardyce because he will keep getting him goals.\nNewcastle had already given him two chances before he scored, so it was criminal to give him a third - I knew he would take it and it was a very good finish.\nSunday was a big occasion for Benitez's first home game in charge anyway because it was Sunderland and because of what had happened the last few times they met - Newcastle had lost the previous six.\nAfter being 1-0 down with seven minutes to go, it is a positive that Benitez has got his first point on the board, but he has got another gigantic game coming up when his side play Norwich after the international break.\nThe Canaries will go into it full of confidence after two clean sheets on the spin and four points from their past two games against West Brom and Manchester City.\nLosing to Sunderland would have been bad enough as it would have left Newcastle four points adrift of safety - but the Magpies simply cannot afford to be beaten at Carrow Road.\nIf they do lose, it is probably curtains for their survival hopes. The Canaries would be six points above them.\nIt will be the same when Sunderland go to Norwich on 16 April. After those two games, we will know a lot more about each team's survival chances.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNorwich were the big winners this weekend because they got a great victory at West Brom, but it will not always be like that - I am expecting different teams will have the better result week to week.\nLooking at the bigger picture, nothing has changed at the bottom. Crystal Palace lost again but one more win will probably put them safe.\nAston Villa are as good as down, so it is still any two from three teams - Newcastle, Sunderland and Norwich - who will go with them.\nAm I positive about Newcastle's chances? No. But, if you asked me the same question about any of those three sides, my answer would be the same.\nI don't think a fan who supports any of them could say with any confidence that they are staying up.\nThis is a relegation battle that is going right to the end and it is going to be very tight.\nAlan Shearer was talking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","7":"The SNP's Mhairi Black said extra help should be directed towards women \"shafted and short-changed\" by state pension increases - and her stance was overwhelmingly backed by MPs.\nMinisters had \"made a mistake\" by rushing the measure through, she said.\n\"It's leaving a lot of women out of pocket,\" she told BBC's Woman's Hour.\nPlans to increase the state pension age for women from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020 were initially set out in 1995.\n'Undue hardship'\nBut the coalition government decided to speed up the process in 2011, resulting in the state pension age for women increasing to 65 in November 2018 and then to 66 by October 2020.\nThe SNP and Labour warned the 2011 decision to accelerate the rate at which state pension age is to be equalised with men \"directly discriminates\" against women born on or after 6 April 1951.\nThey claim these women have been forced to rethink their retirement plans on relatively short notice, causing \"undue hardship\".\nIn a backbench debate led by Ms Black, MPs overwhelmingly backed calls for the government to introduce further transitional arrangements for those women negatively affected by the changes, by 158 votes to 0.\nWhile the motion is non-binding, which means the government is not compelled to do anything, Ms Black - who also called for an independent pensions commission to look into the problem - said the scale of support for the measure showed the strength of feeling among MPs.\n\"It's about highlighting to the government that they've made a mistake here and they've got to do something about it,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour shortly after the vote.\n\"And it's about putting pressure on them to make sure that those women don't lose out on something they've paid into all their lives.\"\nBlame game?\nPressed on whether the introduction of transitional arrangements to address the problem would mean young people footing the bill, Ms Black commented: \"Everything government does costs billions of pounds.\n\"If we can find the money to throw billions at nuclear weapons; if we can find the money to send air strikes to Syria, then why can't we find the money that pensioners are quite rightly entitled?\"\nMs Black said many pensioners were continuing to work beyond their capability or health, which in turn meant fewer jobs for young people.\nBut during the Commons debate, Work and Pensions Minister Shailesh Vara argued that the new state pension would benefit many women who lost out under the current two-tier system.\n\"All those affected by the 2011 changes will reach pension age after the introduction of the new state pension,\" he said.\n\"Around 650,000 reaching state pension age in the first 10 years will receive an average of \u00c2\u00a38 a week more under the new state pension than they would have under the previous system.\"\nThe minister said it was \"regrettable that MPs had sought \"to put the blame post-2010 onwards.\"\nHe claimed 10 pensions ministers during the Labour administration of 1997-2010 had \"totally failed to do anything.\"","8":"Relatives and friends had reacted angrily after the families were told ribbons tied to a bridge near the crash scene would have to be removed.\nWest Sussex County Council (WSCC) agreed plans with families on Friday.\nGina Chirico, victim Mark Trussler's fiancee, said: \"We're more than happy.\"\nShelley Spooner, a friend of Matt Jones who died in the disaster, said the temporary memorial would be a steel arch and people would be able to tie ribbons to it.\nThe Shoreham toll bridge became the focus of commemorations for the people who died when a 1950s Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August.\nIt was covered with flowers but they were eventually removed.\nWSCC leader Louise Goldsmith said: \"We wanted to find a place where people could have somewhere to reflect.\n\"We have to recognise people are grieving, this is a terrible tragedy, and there's something about having a focal place where people can go.\n\"We're also aware that it's coming up to birthdays, anniversaries and Christmas.\n\"Although the bridge is marvellous, is it the right place really to leave everything?\"\nMs Goldsmith said it was not known how long it would take to design the fixed memorial nor what it would look like but the arch would provide somewhere to go in the meantime.\nA tree of remembrance is also being considered for Christmas.\nMs Goldsmith said new ribbons could be attached to the memorial when it was ready, and ribbons currently on the bridge would be stored.\nThe ribbons on the bridge would remain there until the steel arch was ready, she said.","9":"The all-out strikes will take place from 08:00 BST to 17:00 BST from 12 to 16 September with more dates to follow.\nThe British Medical Association took the step after members rejected the deal brokered between the union and government earlier this year.\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was \"devastating news\" for patients.\nMr Hunt said people would be asking why the BMA, which had \"championed this deal as a good deal for doctors\" were now willing to \"inflict the worse doctors' strike in NHS history on patients, making them absolutely miserable\".\nHe added: \"Perhaps 100,000 operations will now have to be cancelled, around a million hospital appointments will have to be postponed, causing worry, distress and anxiety for families up and down the country.\"\nAnd he called again for talks with junior doctor representatives to resolve the ongoing dispute.\nThe union said members felt the contract did not do enough to reward those who work the most weekends, was unfair on part-time workers and there was strong opposition to the fact that it was being forced on them.\nConfidential papers drawn up by the BMA have suggested there could be five days of strikes each month for the rest of the year, the BBC understands.\nJunior doctors' row: The basics of the dispute\nThe announcement reignites the long-running and bitter dispute. Junior doctors have taken part in six days of strikes this year, including two all-out stoppages.\nIndustrial action was put on hold in May when the two sides got back round the table at conciliation service Acas.\nThat resulted in a new contract being agreed, which BMA leaders encouraged members to accept.\nBut when it was put to the vote, 58% of medics rejected it, prompting the resignation of the BMA junior doctor leader Johann Malawana, and ministers to once again announce they would impose the new terms and conditions.\nA new junior doctor leader, Dr Ellen McCourt, was appointed and, in August, the committee she leads called for the union's leaders to sanction fresh strikes.\nDr McCourt said action was being taken as the contract, which will start being rolled out in October, \"fails to treat all doctors fairly\".\n\"The government has consistently said this is about creating a seven-day NHS, when junior doctors already work weekends and it's been shown that the government has no answer to how it will staff and fund extra weekend care.\n\"With just weeks before the first group of doctors is moved onto the imposed contract, time is running out. This contract will be in place for many years, it will have a direct impact on patient care and whether we can attract and keep enough doctors in the NHS. It is too important to be rushed to meet a political deadline.\n\"We have a simple ask of the government: stop the imposition. If it agrees to do this, junior doctors will call off industrial action.\"\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"As doctors' representatives, the BMA should be putting patients first not playing politics in a way that will be immensely damaging for vulnerable patients.\n\"What's more, the BMA must be the first union in history to call for strike action against a deal they themselves negotiated and said was a good one.\"\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter","10":"PM Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial proposal had split the cabinet, with 13 voting for and seven against.\nThe cabinet also backed a bill requiring any peace deal with the Palestinians to be put to a referendum.\nPalestinian sources have suggested peace talks, stalled since 2010, could restart next week.\nSome 104 long-term Palestinian prisoners will be released in four stages over a number of months, linked to progress in the peace process.\nIn addition to the votes for and against in cabinet, there were two abstentions, a government official said. One source told Associated Press that two ministers from Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party voted no.\nSome of the prisoners have carried out militant attacks that claimed Israeli lives and were jailed for up to 30 years.\nSunday's cabinet meeting was delayed by an hour as Mr Netanyahu sought support.\n\"This moment is not easy for me, is not easy for the cabinet ministers, and is not easy especially for the bereaved families, whose feelings I understand,\" Mr Netanyahu said shortly before the meeting.\n\"But there are moments in which tough decisions must be made for the good of the nation and this is one of those moments.\"\nAhead of the meeting, Deputy Defence Minister Danny Danon condemned the proposal, telling Israel Radio: \"This is a political mistake, it is an ethical mistake. The message we are sending the terrorists is that we eventually free them as heroes.\"\nBut Kadoura Fares, the head of a Palestinian advocacy group for prisoners, said that there would be \"no negotiations unless they are all released\".\nThe bill on a referendum is seen as a conciliatory gesture to right-wing members of the government who are wary of concessions Israel might have to make during peace process negotiations.\nA statement from Mr Netanyahu's office said that it was \"important that on such historic decisions every citizen should vote directly\".\n\"Any agreement which may be reached in negotiations will be put to a referendum,\" the office said.\nThe Israeli government will seek \"urgent and important\" approval for the bill, asking parliament to fast-track its passage.\nIt has been suggested by Palestinian sources, although not confirmed officially, that peace talks could start again in the US next week.\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry announced on 19 July that the talks would begin \"in the next week or so\".\nHe said the parties had \"reached an agreement that establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis\".\nThe Palestinians have insisted Israel recognise pre-1967 ceasefire lines as borders of a Palestinian state, subject to some negotiation, before any talks commence, but this is something that has been opposed by right-wing members of Mr Netanyahu's coalition.\nThe issue of settlement-building halted the last direct talks in September 2010.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he will also put any peace deal to a referendum.","11":"US singer Richard Marx said last week that he had intervened to help restrain a disruptive passenger on a Korean Air flight from Hanoi to Seoul.\nCrew had been \"ill-trained\" and \"ill-equipped\", Marx said.\nThe airlines said it would also review the use of Taser guns on board.\n\"Korean Air will react more firmly and actively against in-flight violence that threatens the overall safety of the flight,\" it said in a statement.\nAs part of the changes, the airline said it would be providing more training to staff and hiring more male flight attendants, making sure at least one male is on duty in the cabin for each flight, according to Reuters news agency.\nMarx's wife Daisy Fuentes, who was travelling with the singer, said the staff \"didn't know how to use the taser\" or to secure ropes.\nTaser is a brand name often used to refer to electric stun guns.\n\"We have decided to improve our conditions and procedure on using Taser guns to cope with violent acts and disturbances on board in a fast and efficient manner,\" it added, but did not elaborate on how the rules would change.\nThe airline said that under existing rules, stun guns were permitted for use only in \"grave\" situations - where the safety of a flight or the life of passengers and crew were in danger.\nThis meant staff had been \"hesitant\" to use the equipment, the carrier added.\nIndividual airlines have their own policies on what equipment they carry on board to restrain passengers\nMost carriers contacted by the BBC were unwilling to give details of what kit this included, citing security concerns.","12":"The Victims' Forum held discussions with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers.\nThe recent inter-party talks did not bring an agreement on legacy issues.\nMs Villiers said that the government was prepared to consider \"alternatives\" when negotiating on the key issue of national security.\nThe government has been accused of failing to deliver on a commitment made in the Stormont House Agreement, by insisting on a veto on material to protect national security.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Ms Villiers said: \"We put some compromises on the table in relation to national security, such as a direct right of appeal to the High Court. We feel that we stretched ourselves on that but we're obviously open to consideration of alternatives.\"\nShe also said that agreement on the matter was closer than ever before.\n\"There's a long list of other issues which have been more or less resolved, so I continue to be optimistic about the prospect of getting these bodies up and running sometime soon,\" she said.\nThe Victims' Forum described the meeting as \"very positive\".\nJennifer McNern, who lost both legs in the Abercorn bombing in 1972, said: \"I'm more confident than I was a couple of weeks ago that the secretary of state will speak to politicians again, hopefully with new energy and a will to compromise.\"\nMitch Bresland, a former UDR member, said: \"We took some reassurance from the fact that the secretary of state had plans, and she felt we could move forward.\"\nOn Sunday, Northern Ireland's victims' commissioner said new talks between the political parties to try and get agreement on dealing with outstanding legacy issues needed to start now.\nJudith Thompson told the Sunday Politics programme there was a level of energy and common purpose that was not there before.\nLast month, a deal, known as Fresh Start, was agreed between the British and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in.\nIt followed 10 weeks of talks and secured agreement on outstanding issues relating to paramilitaries and welfare reform.\nHowever, they failed to break the deadlock over legacy issues arising from Northern Ireland's Troubles.","13":"Dave Edwards' header put Wolves ahead inside the opening three minutes, only for City striker Tammy Abraham to fire in his 14th goal of the season.\nAden Flint then headed the visitors in front before half-time.\nBut Helder Costa's volley made it 2-2, and Cavaleiro scored from the spot after Flint's handball to win it.\nThere was more drama right at the very end of the match when Marlon Pack's header was cleared off the line, with City's players and supporters feeling it had snuck over.\nBut Wolves survived to record back-to-back victories for the first time since August, moving them above the Robins to 15th in the Championship table in the process.\nCity, whose manager Lee Johnson remonstrated with the referee on the pitch after full-time, slipped to 17th having lost 10 of their past 13 matches in all competitions.\nWolves boss Paul Lambert: \"We were brilliant.

The gymnastics club sent a letter home with her, requesting that she joined tumbling or gymnastics.\nShe was home schooled in her secondary education to allow her to train.\nHer favourite gymnastics event is floor.\nHer hobbies include shopping and hanging out with friends and her favourite food is Italian.\nSimone is four feet and eight inches tall - but manages to leap higher than any of her competitors.\nHer coach says Simone can learn a new skill in three days, whereas other gymnasts can take months or even years to master a new move.\nHer powerful run allows her to include more elements in her routine than others, who have to run further before they can start tumbling.\nAt 19 years old, she has the most World Championships gold medals of any female gymnast in the world.\nSimone even invented her own move for her floor routines, which is now named after her.\nIt is a double backward somersault, followed by a half-twist and a blind landing. At the highest peak of the move, she leaps nearly twice her height.\nUntil she first performed 'The Biles' in 2013, it had never been tried in competition before.\nA video of Simone winking and smiling at a former Olympic gymnast during a routine was watched 11 million times in the first few days of it being posted online.\nShe's the most searched for gymnast on Google.\nAfter she won her all-around gold medal in Rio, she was trending on Twitter straightaway, with two-and-a-half times more tweets than anything, or anyone.\nShe even has her own emojis called... you guessed it... Simoji.\nVarious companies sponsor her and want to be associated with her, including: Nike, Kellogg's and United Airlines.\nIt's estimated she earns $2 million dollars a year (\u00c2\u00a31.5 million pounds) but she could earn more after her success at the Rio Olympics.","16":"The Italian, who is 29 on Tuesday, has agreed a three-year contract to link up again with manager Ronald Koeman.\nPelle scored 55 goals in 66 matches for Feyenoord under Dutchman Koeman, who was named Saints boss on 16 June.\nWe need more players to bring the squad to where we need and expect\nThe former Parma player said: \"This is going to be the best choice for me because the club wants to keep improving every year.\"\nHe is Saints' second signing of the summer, following the \u00a310.9m arrival of FC Twente attacking midfielder Dusan Tadic.\nPelle initially joined Feyenoord on loan from Serie A side Parma in 2012, before joining the Dutch club on a permanent basis in January 2013.\nHe moves to St Mary's after Saints sold England striker Rickie Lambert to Liverpool for about \u00a34m last month.\nKoeman said: \"We needed a good player in that position.\n\"He's a tall striker with a lot of movement and he's fast.

Tonnes of timber are needed to keep the house warm in winter.\nIain's mother, Val, also lives on the croft. She and her family moved from Cardiff to Cougie in 1962 seeking an alternative to city life.\nSixty percent of her pension goes on paying for fuel.\nThe Pococks say they cannot get grants to install a larger turbine or solar panels because the funding requires surplus power to be exported to the Grid.\nIronically, the croft is close to a massive multi-million pound electricity project.\nEnergy giant SSE is upgrading the 137-mile (220km) Beauly to Denny transmission circuit.\nThe 400,000-volt line will triple the capacity of the existing system, and eventually transmit vast amounts of energy from planned renewable power schemes in the Highlands to central Scotland.\nSix hundred new towers are being built - a reduction of 200 on the existing number.

Watch it at 23:20 GMT on Monday 25 November on BBC One (except in Wales or Northern Ireland) or later on iPlayer.\nThe Editors\nEnergy: What's the least worst option?\nMarkets need competition, transparency on pricing and genuine choice for consumers.\nSo does the domestic energy industry tick all those boxes?\nAfter retail energy was opened up to competition in 1998, about 15 suppliers vied to win customers.\nWithin five years that number had been reduced to six, which has largely remained the case ever since.\nProf Catherine Waddams, from the University of East Anglia, is a leading expert on the domestic energy market and has been studying it closely ever since privatisation.\nShe told me: \"There's some competition in this market - there could be more - it's worrying the way profits have gone up in recent years. We really need to understand what isn't working.\"\nThe Big Six suppliers provide about 98% of all household energy and gas. They also control 74% of electricity generation.\nSome critics argue this so-called vertical integration, with power generation and retailing joined together, could discourage new players coming into the market.\nSo which industries work better for its customers than energy? Airlines and airports have seen ownership changes and new competitors coming in and cutting fares.\nJohn Fingleton, a former boss of the Office of Fair Trading, told me: \"The airline business is incredibly competitive. Customers can compare fares easily, they can switch airlines and new players can enter the market.\n\"Airlines can switch airports and get better deals. With domestic energy, it's very difficult for consumers to compare prices and for new players to get into the market.\"\nMr Fingleton wants a full-blown inquiry into domestic energy by the Competition Commission, just as there was a few years ago for the airport industry.\nA key challenge is creating a level playing field for smaller competitors.\nOne of those biting at the heels of the Big Six is Ecotricity, based in Stroud, Gloucestershire.\nThe founder, Dale Vince, told me signing up customers was not easy.\nHe said: \"The switching process is complicated, sometimes unnecessarily so. It's probably flawed from a customer point of view because the Big Six can make things very difficult.\"\nMr Vince said the complex systems regulators require energy retailers to have can deter smaller companies.\nThose systems required between \u00c2\u00a32m and \u00c2\u00a33m of investment, he said, whereas his start-up costs in the 1990s had been only about \u00c2\u00a310,000.\nI was shown around Eon's gas-fired generation plant at Enfield in north London by director of strategy and regulation Sara Vaughan, who said retail customers could see easily what sort of deals they were getting in comparison with other offers.\nShe said Eon had a clear internal split between its generation activities and supplying households.\nBut her company accepted a full independent inquiry was the only way to test whether the market really was working and restore the trust of consumers.\nShe said: \"Trust has to be earned - it lies behind our call for a Competition Commission inquiry. We want to show people we are open and we are really prepared to have an organisation come in and look into our business.\"\nBut are things any better elsewhere in Europe?\nIn Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, competition is seen as more effective than in the UK, partly because their markets are more connected, though in others it's a different story.\nIn Brussels the European Commission's top energy regulator, Philip Lowe, told me there was a problem across the EU.\nHe said: \"The UK situation is mirrored elsewhere and is worse elsewhere because there are fewer competitors in the market.\n\"Some national markets have only one supplier.\n\"But it's not enough to just have more than one supplier.\n\"You actually need the information to make an intelligent choice on switching.\"\nIn my conversations with experts I heard no argument in favour of the domestic energy market or any claim it was working well.\nBut there was a clear view there were no quick fixes available to politicians.\nThere is growing pressure for a robust competition inquiry, though this could take a couple of years.\nQuestions are being asked over whether consumers across Europe get a fair deal. While wholesale energy prices rise, the debate will get noisier.\nBut making the market work better could require unplugging the industry's complex structure and rebuilding it.\nBBC News: The Editors features the BBC's on-air specialists asking questions that reveal deeper truths about their areas of expertise.

Most were clapping him back and then you get this one idiot.\n\"Chris had given his shirt to a little girl. He didn't deserve that to happen to him.\n\"I have supported Albion for 50 years but I was ashamed to be an Albion fan on Saturday.\"\nUp to 30 Albion fans have come forward so far to hold buckets outside the ground and go into pubs near The Hawthorns.\nAll money raised will go to a charity of the Northern Ireland international's choice, added Green.\nA West Brom spokesman said: \"It's a fan-led initiative and we are trying to co-ordinate it. It's got the club's blessing and it's got Chris's blessing.\"\nWest Brom will feature an image of long-serving Brunt on the front cover of Saturday's programme above the word 'loyalty'.\nBrunt, who can also play in midfield, joined West Brom from Sheffield Wednesday in 2007 and has played 313 games for the club.","20":"The military needed to \"fortify\" the city, which had a population of more than two million, to prevent an assault \"from all directions\", they said.\nThe Boko Haram militants had \"annexed\" areas that were about 50km (30 miles) from Maiduguri, they said.\nBoko Haram declared a caliphate in areas it controls last month.\nWithout mentioning the statement issued by the Borno Elders Forum (BEF), the defence ministry has dismissed \"alarmist\" reports on Maiduguri.\nOn its Twitter account, it said \"Security Arrangements for the Defence of Maiduguri has been upgraded to handle any planned attack\".\nThe BEF represents influential people in the state, including former government ministers and civil servants.\nBoko Haram has also captured territory in neighbouring Adamawa state, forcing people to flee into hills, where they are eating leaves, residents told the BBC.\n\"We are convinced that the Federal Government of Nigeria has not shown sufficient political will to fight Boko Haram and rescue us from the clutches of the insurgents which may ultimately lead to the total annihilation of the inhabitants of Borno,\" BEF said.\n\"The insurgents have rendered impassable almost all the roads leading to Maiduguri,\" it added.\nBEF said the military needed to \"urgently fortify\" the city, where Boko Haram was founded in 2002.\n\"The insurgents have surrounded Maiduguri and are nursing the ambition of attacking the city from all directions,\" BEF said.\nThe BBC's Bashir Sa'ad Abdullahi in the capital, Abuja, says tens of thousands of people are taking refuge in Maiduguri after fleeing Boko Haram's advance.\nIt is unclear what is happening in territory under their control in Borno, as the mobile telephone network in many places is down, he says.\nIn Adamawa, the military has launched an air and ground assault to recapture the town of Michika, seized by Boko Haram on Sunday.\nWho are Boko Haram?\nResidents said people in Michika were trapped between the bombs of the Nigerian air force and the militants who shoot anyone that dares move, at times slitting their throats.\nOne woman told the BBC many children were trapped in her house and had no idea where their parents were.\nA man said seven people had died where he was sheltering and they could not be buried.\nMichika has a population of about 700,000, and is the gateway to Adamawa's commercial hub, Mubi.\nBoko Haram's five-year insurgency is seen as the biggest threat to Nigeria's territorial integrity since the 1967-70 civil war, analysts say.\nThe group has changed tactics in recent months, holding on to towns in the north-east, where most people are Muslims, rather than carrying out hit-and-run attacks.","21":"I had moved across the country to find my daughter, Trista, but the deadly warehouse fire in Oakland in December forced me to take the first step, the one I had been dreading.\nAfter hearing that people actually lived in the warehouse of artists' studios and performance spaces known as the Ghost Ship, I needed to see for myself, to ensure Trista - the name I'll call her to protect her privacy - was not among the dead.\nAt the scene many had gathered to grieve and pay their respects. There were also people like me, who had lost touch with their loved ones for weeks, months, or even years, and were fearful they were inside when the fire started.\nI took the advice of an officer and drove to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, where they had set up a makeshift family assistance centre to provide emotional support and privacy for the family members. We waited for updates from Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf and found comfort in a safe place, together.\nOn one wall inside the centre were three lists: the confirmed dead, those who had been located and were safe, and those still reported as missing. On that last list were about 150 names.\nI knew then I was far from alone. Somehow, it made it easier to speak the words I'd refused to let myself believe: \"My daughter is missing.\"\nUnlike TV, where missing people are portrayed as victims of sexual trafficking or serial murderers, most adults disappear for far less sinister reasons. As of late December, the California justice department had 20,470 reports of missing persons in the state.\nOf those, 7,854 are like my daughter, classified as \"voluntary missing adults\".\nMore than 8,000 are runaways.\nAnother 1,060 people were taken by a family member, while 764 disappeared under suspicious circumstances and 114 went missing during a catastrophe.\nAt just 51, stranger abduction cases number the lowest.\nThe 48 hours in the family assistance centre were among the most painful in my life, as I struggled to answer one question after another.\nWhen did you last hear from your daughter?\nJune.\nDid you file a missing persons report?\nNo.\nDo you have a preferred funeral home?\nNo.\nA few months earlier I had packed up everything I owned, leaving behind family and friends to follow Trista's path west. I didn't tell them the real reason I was leaving - I wouldn't rest until I knew where Trista was.\nA kind and caring free spirit, Trista had gravitated to places like the Ghost Ship in the past. I knew that she might have lived there because this was her community: musicians, artists and other creative people.\nWhen I went to work for a small start-up in Oakland in 2009, she lived with me, then later followed me back to West Virginia.\nFrom there she travelled to Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, meeting up with fellow musicians. She was content to live in her own world, collecting items cast to the kerb and transforming them into beautiful works of art.\nBut by 2014, while I was put the finishing touches on a true crime book about a missing daughter, Trista was becoming increasingly distant and withdrawn.\nBy then, my daughter's temporary forays into seclusion had become legendary.\nI had been trying to understand them for 10 years because, at times weeks or even months would pass without so much as a word.\nBut I always knew she would reach out to someone - my sister, her brother, my mother.\nNot this time, though.\nTrista terminated all but two ties in February 2015, when she returned to the Bay Area.\nBy June 2016, the last time I heard from her, she severed the rest.\nI called her brother in San Francisco: he hadn't heard from her in a year.\nShe changed her cell phone number. All of my emails to her bounced back.\n\"The email account that you tried to reach does not exist,\" Google repeatedly told me.\nThis wasn't my first trip to Oakland to look for Trista. I drove there one month before the fire. I needed to check out our old neighbourhood in case my daughter had returned. She hadn't.\nSome of the victims of the fire were LGBT or made outcasts in other ways; people who believed their families had given up on them - or vice versa.\nBut families like mine with missing children don't give up. We may stumble around, accidentally making matters worse.\nBut it is never intentional. I met a few other parents whose children died in the fire.\nThey didn't leave until the last handful of charred ashes was carried from the scene - when they knew for sure their child was truly, finally gone.\nYoung and talented: Tributes pour in for Oakland fire dead\nA day after the fire, I finally forced myself to open the laptop Trista left behind in West Virginia a year earlier.\nI spent hours reaching out to her friends, fellow musicians, and a previous employer.\nThey hadn't heard from her in years. No one knew anything.\nIt was like Trista had closed the door on her old life, never to reopen it again.\nBut I couldn't just wait for a phone call telling me if my daughter was dead or alive. I had to know myself, so I drove to Oakland from Sacramento.\nAnd waited, for as long as it took.\nAfter spending two days at the family services centre, I stumbled into my hotel room, still struggling with the enormity of it all. What will I do if they find her? What if they don't?\nThe following morning, one of the mental health professionals on hand to help the families guided me down a corridor and into an office.\nThere, two women greeted me from the state justice department's missing persons unit.\n\"We've located 1,000 people since 2001,\" they said.\n\"Even a few live Jane Does,\" they added hopefully.\nThey asked more questions. I signed more paperwork. Then, after careful instructions, a gloved hand gave me what looked like a pink and white emery board.\nI opened my mouth, did as they directed, and handed over my saliva - my DNA - and the only link to my daughter.\nI just wanted to find Trista. Beg for her forgiveness. Tell her I was sorry - for me, for my mistakes, and for not understanding her well enough. For my family, who did likewise, and in whose heart she still holds a sacred place.\nGiven that all 36 victims of the Ghost Ship fire have been identified, I have to believe Trista is still alive. Still out there, somewhere.\nLike the 150 or so other worried mothers of those on the missing list, I have but one thought: I love you.\nPlease come back to me.\nOr - at the very least - phone home.\nDaleen Berry is a New York Times bestselling writer and author of several books, including Shatter the Silence and Pretty Little Killers.","22":"In a career spanning nearly 40 years, Frans de Waal has cemented a reputation as one of the leading authorities on the behaviour of great apes.\nThe Dutch-born professor at Emory University in Georgia, US, has made a major contribution to our understanding of primate communities - uncovering many parallels with human societies.\nBut he's not impressed with the way our evolutionary cousins have often been portrayed on screen.\n\"If they were shown in a respectful way, that would be one thing. But they are usually made to be clowns, which is not helpful for the conservation case or the ethical case,\" he tells me.\nSo what did this top primatologist think of the new instalment in the Planet of the Apes franchise?\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes, which goes on release in the US on Friday, is a bold sequel to the 2011 re-boot. That movie - Rise of the Planet of the Apes - saw a group of genetically modified primates revolt against their human masters.\nThe new film continues the story of that rebellion's instigator, an intelligent chimpanzee by the name of Caesar, but picks up his story after a manmade virus has devastated the human population. Amid the rubble of our civilisation, the apes are pitted against surviving pockets of Homo sapiens in a battle for mastery of the planet.\nProf de Waal calls the storyline \"impressive\", adding: \"I'm not usually into action films like this one, but this held my attention.\n\"The apes are very humanised: They walk on two legs, they talk - somewhat - they shed tears. In real life, apes do a lot of crying and screaming, but they don't produce tears like we do.\"\nHowever, other aspects of ape behaviour in the film, he says, are true to life.\n\"We know chimpanzees are aggressive and territorial - they wage war. The use of tools and weapons is also a possibility,\" he explains.\nTo quote a colleague in his field, he said: \"If you gave guns to chimps, they would use them.\"\nThe primatologist says the reconciliation following a fight between Caesar and Koba - a bonobo character in the film - rang true in terms of ape interactions. He says he also recognised real-life behaviour in a scene where the apes are seen bowing before their appointed leader.\nIn real groups, Prof de Waal says, \"when an alpha male makes an appearance, the other apes grovel and make themselves appear small\".\nBut he draws attention to the contrast between the thoughtful male chimp Caesar and Koba - a bonobo - who is the most aggressive character in the film.\n\"It's strange because, in reality, the bonobo is a more peaceful ape than the chimpanzee. There is also the character of an orang-utan, who is interested in teaching and in books, so they have added some twists to it.\"\nFans will recognise this as an allusion to the position of orangs as a clerical caste in the ape society depicted by the 60s and 70s films and the 1963 novel by French writer Pierre Boule, on which the movies were based.\nIn real life, orang-utan males are rather solitary, but actress Karin Konoval, who plays the orang Maurice in both Dawn and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, says she understands why the forest primates were characterised as wise elders.\n\"At core, they are the watchers, who are able to assess everything. They never do anything gratuitously,\" she told BBC News.\n\"There is nothing gratuitous that I've ever seen with any of the orang-utans I've known. They are very specific and clear in every choice that they make.\"\nTo prepare for the role of Maurice - the trusted confidant of Caesar, played by British actor Andy Serkis  - Ms Konoval studied videos of the animals and read \"every book that had been written\" about the apes.\n\"The movement of a mature male orang-utan is very specific. So one of the challenges I had on Rise [of the Planet of the Apes] was getting the weight right in my performance. I'm a 120lb woman, and Maurice is a 250lb orang-utan male. One of the things we did in the original film was to weight down my arm stilts,\" she says.\nBut she says that being invited to spend time with the five orang-utans at Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle gave her a wealth of experience to bring to her performance in Dawn. Her initial introduction to the group was via a 40-year-old orang male called Tuan, who has something of an artistic streak.\n\"I watched him paint on a canvas for an hour, an hour-and-a-half at a time. He moves the canvas around and considers it as he goes; this is not slapping the paint around. It was a real artwork. It was amazing,\" she says.\nIf the studio were to make another instalment, Prof de Waal says he would advise the filmmakers to include more female and juvenile ape characters, to give a sense of real group dynamics among the animals. In the wild, gorilla and orang males rarely co-operate, as they do in the film, though this is more likely for chimps.\nBut he praises the film's \"astonishing\" visual effects, which leads us on to an issue that exercises the professor - the welfare of primates in entertainment.\nProf de Waal strongly opposes the use of real primate actors in advertising, film and television, and comments that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' realistic depictions of apes using computer technology alone proves that the industry has no need for the genuine article.\n\"I hope the practice disappears completely,\" he tells me.\n\"The first Planet of the Apes movie raised some philosophical issues: What are the ethics of keeping humans in a cage? Which is a reversal of the issue we are faced with now: What are the ethics of keeping an ape in a cage?\"\nSo if apes really did usurp humans as the dominant group on the planet, what does de Waal think it would be like with chimps, bonobos, gorillas and orangs at the top of the pecking order?\n\"Hmmm,\" he replies, pausing for a moment. \"I'm not an optimist in that regard. The male chimpanzee is very aggressive. I'm not sure they would be angels of peace, as Caesar is in this movie.\n\"The bonobo would be a more peaceful character - they do not wage war on other groups as chimpanzees do. These groups have even been shown to mingle in the wild on occasion.\"\n\"It would be more like Woodstock - and a completely different movie.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.","23":"Three officers were shot dead by an eastern European gang in a bungled east London burglary in December 1910.\nThe murders led to the famous Siege of Sidney Street, in Stepney, east London, in January 1911.\nCity of London Police unveiled the first memorial to Sgt Bentley, Sgt Tucker and Pc Choat at a ceremony at the scene of the tragedy.\nOn 16 December 1910, a gang of Latvian revolutionaries tried to rob a jeweller's shop in Houndsditch.\nThe gang fired on unarmed officers, killing three and seriously injuring two.\nTwo of the gang members escaped and hid out in rooms at 100 Sidney Street.\nWinston Churchill watched events unfold\nSidney St: The siege that shook Britain\nThe police were tipped off by an informant and in the early hours of 3 January 1911, hundreds of officers surrounded the house and evacuated homes in the area.\nWinston Churchill, the then home secretary, was in a crowd of thousands watching from the sidelines as hundreds of police officers and a company of Scots Guards engaged in a gun battle with the gang members.\nDuring the siege, the two suspects were killed and a firefighter suffered fatal injuries.\nA plaque in memory of the firefighter, Superintendent Charles Pearson, will be unveiled on 6 January, on the building that stands on the former site of 100 Sidney Street.\nDonald Rumbelow, a former City of London Police officer, and author of The Houndsditch Murders and The Siege Of Sidney Street, said the memorial to the three murdered policemen was \"long overdue\".\n\"A lot of people know about the siege but don't know about the Houndsditch murders,\" he said.\nThursday's event was due to be attended by Lord Mayor of London Michael Bear and City of London Police Commissioner Mike Bowron, as well as descendants of the three officers.","24":"Rangers confirmed that Jardine had lost an 18-month battle against cancer on Thursday evening.\nHe was part of their European Cup Winners' Cup-winning team of 1972 and played 38 times for his country.\nHe was respected not only by Rangers fans but also the wider football community\nIbrox manager Ally McCoist said everyone at Rangers was devastated at the loss of \"a legend\" and \"a great man\".\nAnd the club said their thoughts were with his wife Shona, children Steven and Nicola, his grandchildren and friends.\nHearts also extended their condolences to his family, with the Tynecastle club adding they were deeply saddened at the death of a club legend.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEdinburgh-born Jardine began his career with Rangers in 1965 and went on to make over 600 appearances for the Ibrox side.\nAs well as playing in the club's European triumph in 1972, the full-back won three top-flight titles, five Scottish Cups and five Scottish League Cups with Rangers.\nA move to Hearts followed in 1982 and, along with former Rangers team-mate Alex MacDonald, he was joint-manager at Tynecastle between 1986 and 1988.\nUnder their command, the Edinburgh club lost out on the Scottish title on the final day of the 1985-86 season, Celtic taking advantage of Hearts' defeat at Dundee to pip them to the crown.\nJardine's on-field contribution that term was such, though, that he was named Scotland's player of the year for the second time at the age of 37. The honour came 11 years after he first won the award.\nAfter his playing career ended, he returned to work for Rangers in various roles.

Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns.\nThe key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers.\nSome 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money provided either by the member states themselves or by the European Stability Mechanism, an official EU agency which gets its funds in the financial markets but is financially underpinned by the eurozone countries.\nAnother 10% is owed to the International Monetary Fund which is ultimately backed by global taxpayers. It doesn't generally do debt relief.\nThe European Central Bank accounts for 6%. It is banned from giving relief on that by EU law. The country's debt to private sector creditors has already heavily cut back in 2012.   The remainder is a variety of creditors including banks, pension funds and other investors in Greece and abroad.\nThere is a fudge that could be used to ease the Greek debt burden, and it has already been used. That is to reduce the interest rate on its debts to the eurozone and extend the repayment period without actually cutting the nominal value of the debt to be repaid.\nTo give ground to Syriza could also be read as suggesting that the austerity approach was a fundamental mistake.\nAfter all many economists argued that cutting government spending and raising taxes was exactly the wrong thing to do in economies that were already weak.  Austerity aggravated the weakness, they argued, and so undermined tax revenue and exacerbated the government financial problems it was supposed to fix.\nAnother problem for Germany and those that share its view is that concessions to Syriza might embolden anti-austerity political forces in other countries.\nSpain's Podemos party is a striking recent arrival on the political scene, but others will also be watching developments in Greece very closely.\nThat potential for political \"contagion\" from Greece to other countries is probably more of a worry for the eurozone than a repeat of the kind of financial and economic contagion we saw when the crisis was at its most intense, in 2011.\nThat's not to say that type of danger is absent. But the eurozone does have measures in place the reduce the risk.\nThe key one is European Central Bank proposals to buy the debts or bonds of governments whose borrowing costs go too high. This is NOT the policy of quantitative easing announced last week as a response to deflation or falling prices.\nIt is a proposal targeted at ensuring that countries such as Italy and Spain do not face unsustainably high borrowing costs as a result of fears they might end up leaving the euro. It's a policy announced by Mario Draghi in 2012. The mere announcement had the desired effect. It hasn't been used, but it is there if needed.\nBut even if the eurozone can keep the lid on any financial market fears of a wider break-up, the possibility of Greece leaving can't be discounted.\nThe Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras says he doesn't want it and nor does Greek public opinion.  Even Germany doesn't want it, though there is a limit to the concessions that Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble are likely to make.\nSo the odds are that some sort of compromise will emerge. It may well be messy and be slow to take shape. But then did the eurozone ever do anything that's difficult quickly or easily?","28":"Peter Barnes, 50, died when the helicopter he was flying clipped a crane at St George Wharf in Vauxhall, during freezing fog in January 2013.\nPedestrian Matthew Wood, 39, was hit and killed by the falling helicopter.\nThe jury found poor visibility confused the pilot and resulted in the accidental deaths of the two men.\nLatest updates on this case and other London stories\nTwelve other people on the ground were also injured in the crash.\nMr Barnes, a pilot of 24 years, was under great commercial pressure to satisfy an important client that morning when he made the flawed decision to fly, which was \"neither safe nor appropriate\", the inquest heard.\nHe had been flying from Redhill Aerodrome in Surrey to Elstree in Hertfordshire but was diverted to Battersea heliport.\nThe jury accepted the Air Accident Investigation Branch's evidence that Mr Barnes experienced a \"loss of situational awareness\" because of poor visibility, causing the accident.\nRotorMotion, the firm he was flying for, is no longer trading.\nCoroner Andrew Harris addressed the relatives of Mr Barnes and Mr Wood at the inquest.\nHe said nothing would reverse the \"tragic, sudden and completely unexpected\" loss of their loved ones, but added he hoped possible prevention of deaths in future would mean some good could come of the accident.\nEvidence from pilots, air traffic controllers and air crash investigators was included in the three-week inquest.\nAccording to witnesses, pilots had to deal with conflicting rules around flying in the fog.\nThey were told to maintain a 500ft buffer zone from any structure, but flight paths, tall buildings and altitude restrictions often interfered, witnesses told the jury.\nLow cloud cover and freezing fog, the conditions at the time of the crash, further complicated matters for pilots who were forced to descend for better visibility, the court heard.","29":"A boost of A$29.9b ($21.4b, \u00c2\u00a315.4b) over the next decade reflects concern over military expansion in the region.\nThe white paper reiterates Australia's objection to the reclamation of land in the South China Sea and urges ASEAN and China to agree on a code of conduct.\nChina says it is \"seriously concerned\" and has expressed its \"dissatisfaction\" over the defence strategy.\nForeign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying asked Australia to \"take realistic actions\" to work with China to maintain peace and stability in the region.\n\"In the hopes of relieving tensions and the possibility of an arms race, we hope that relevant countries can give up joint drills and stop increasing their military presence in the region,\" Ms Chunying said.\nThe largest investment outlined in the White Paper on Thursday is for submarines to replace Australia's current diesel and electric-powered Collins Class vessels. At a cost of more than A$50b it represents Australia's largest-ever defence procurement.\nAbout 25% of the additional spending will be put towards the most \"comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War\", the Defence document says.\nAustralia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the threats faced by Australia were not limited to foreign conflicts, but also included terrorism, cyber-warfare and climate change.\n\"[This] is a plan to become more powerful on land and in the skies, and more commanding both on the seas and beneath them.

The IFS estimates that 500,000 extra people might have to fill in these forms as a result of the change.\nThey will need to register for self-assessment, if they have not already, by 5 October or face a fine.\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"Withdrawing child benefit on the basis of the combined family income would require intrusive means-testing of all eight million households getting child benefit. The way we are doing it is simpler for the vast majority of families.\"\nBut the stance has not been welcomed by many people who would be affected.\nPaul, from West Sussex, who has a six-year-old son was one of a number of people who reportedly failed to receive a letter from HMRC explaining the options for higher earners on what to do.\nHe told the BBC: \"My salary goes up and down, but we will continue to claim it. But my tax affairs are very simple so the one thing I don't really want to do is the self-assessment thing.\"\nThe deadline has now expired for higher earners to opt out of receiving child benefit. They will still be able to do so, but may still face a tax charge for the time still in the system since 7 January.\nThe latest official figures from HM Revenue and Customs show that 191,873 people have opted out of receiving child benefit - mostly because they know they will consistently earn more than \u00a360,000 a year, or earn over \u00a350,000 and do not want to be pulled into the self-assessment system.\nThat figure was expected to rise above 250,000 over the weekend. These figures will be confirmed later.","31":"The \"unique\" underground shelter stands in the Woodside Road industrial estate on the outskirts of Ballymena, County Antrim, and can house up to 235 people.\nIt was commissioned by the government during the latter stages of the Cold War and construction began in 1987.\nIt contains dormitories, kitchen facilities, decontamination chambers, and has been kept in a \"fit and ready state\" for emergencies since 1990.\nThe bunker is in the ownership of the Office of the First and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM), which hopes to raise about \u00c2\u00a3575,000 from the sale of the 3.74-acre site.\nBBC News NI reported the existence of the bunker in 2007, after submitting a Freedom of Information request.\nThe following year, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) questioned Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness about an alleged list of people \"to be taken there in a moment of peril\".\nMr McGuinness replied that he knew nothing of the bunker and hoped he was not on the list.\nThe then Environment Minister Arlene Foster, who has since become first minister of Northern Ireland,  joked at the time that she had not granted it planning permission.\nThe shelter is one of almost 1,600 nuclear monitoring posts built across the UK since 1955.\nThe property agent Lambert Smith Hampton said the Ballymena bunker was \"believed to be one of the last and most technically advanced buildings of its kind ever built in the UK\".\nIt has \"interlocking double blast doors\", a BBC audio visual broadcasting facility, bathrooms, conference rooms and storage facilities.\nThe firm's surveyor, Andrew Fraser, described it as a \"one of a kind property\".\n\"This is an extremely rare listing and offers a unique opportunity for potential buyers,\" he said.\nThe agents suggested it could be used for tourism, media or storage purposes.","32":"The BBC understands that the DE's aim is to have a common test in place by November 2017.\nThe DE have appointed Professor Peter Tymms, from the school of education at Durham University, to lead the initiative.\nIt is called: \"Towards a common assessment for the purposes of academic selection\".\nHowever, Education Minister Peter Weir told the DUP conference at the weekend that he could not \"impose\" a state-run test.\n\"I have started work with the two testing organisations to see what common ground can be found, with the aim of agreement being facilitated between them,\" he said.\nMr Weir told BBC Northern Ireland's Good Morning Ulster it was clear that while there would not be political agreement around a \"state transfer test\", academic selection was \"here to stay\".\n\"It hasn't gone away because there is a strong demand out there for academic selection,\" he said.\n\"It is clear that academic selection, whether you are in favour or not, is happening and it is here to stay.\n\"I want to try and make the system as easy as possible for the parents of children that are going through this, I think that is a laudable aim.\"\nThe commissioner for children and young people in Northern Ireland, Koulla Yiasouma, said root and branch reform was needed, not a \"further sticking plaster\".\n\"No parent wants to subject their 10 or 11-year-old child to the stress of a number of academic tests, but parents have no choice within the system as it currently stands.\n\"While it is preferable that within a system of unregulated tests, all children take a single regulated test, it is extremely disappointing that the vision for education in Northern Ireland is firmly fixed on the perpetuation of \"academic segregation\".\n\"We need the equivalent of health's Bengoa, we need to get into the crevices of our education system and agree a vision that will result in a system that delivers for each and every child -

Last year, the company's training schemes had 10,000 applicants for 500 places.\nDespite a 2:1 degree, his A-level grades ruled him out of most top accountancy companies.\nMost still require at least the equivalent of three Bs at A-level before they will even consider applicants for trainee posts, either at school-leaver or graduate level. Nick's A-level grades were a B and two Cs.\nSince 2013, Grant Thornton has relied instead on a series of timed online tests and interviews to whittle the applicants down to a shortlist of about 800 for a final interview.\nApplicants are scored on their personal and professional achievements, exam grades and on whether recruiters think they would suit the company's culture.\n\"We regard ourselves as pioneers,\" says senior talent and resourcing manager Richard Waite.\nOverall, some 20% of this year's trainees are people the company would never have considered under the old system.\nA series of other top companies have followed suit, but they are still a minority - a factor that left Nick \"depressed\" once he had made the decision to change careers.\n\"I felt trapped when I was still in the police,\" he says. \"I was looking for a job in accountancy but they were restricted by the grade requirements.\n\"I even phoned up companies and explained what I was doing - but they said unless you meet the requirements you won't even get through the first stage.\"\nMr Waite says he too found the old system frustrating.\nAt school and university careers fairs, he was frequently convinced he had met young people who would fit perfectly with the company's \"down-to earth\" culture, only to to be disappointed when they told him their grades.\n\"Instinctively I knew as a recruiter these people would have been great, but our process was screening them out,\" he says.\n\"What this is about is hiring the best people. Historically that meant people with a certain academic profile, but some great employees don't fit that profile.\n\"We want to tap into pools of talent we have not necessarily tapped before.\"\nLisa Newland, 22, is part of this talent pool. She got great GCSE grades but found A-levels \"heavy going\", got herself a part-time job in a jeweller's and admits she had a bit too much of a good time instead of concentrating on her school work.\nHer A-level grades, two Cs and a D, were disappointing.\nShe could still have gone to university \"but probably not the universities I had in mind at the time\".\n\"I went to have a look, traipsed my mum and dad all round the country, and then decided it wasn't for me,\" she says.\nInstead, she took a clerical job with a smaller accountancy company, commuting to Moorgate daily from her home in Essex for three years.\nShe applied to Grant Thornton's Accelerate Scheme for School Leavers and is now training as a restructuring and recovery specialist for companies in difficulties.\nQualifying as a chartered business adviser or accountant takes four to five years for a school leaver and three years for a graduate.\nExam preparation must be done on top of working full time.\nSo will people with weaker academic records cope? Lisa admits having been nervous.\n\"I thought, 'I am going into four years of exams, having not studied for three years, particularly with the grades I got,'\" she says.\nSo far, however, she has passed them all.\n\"I am a lot more mature than I was three years ago,\" she says.\n\"This was what I wanted to do, so I make sure I am putting the effort to pass them. Obviously it was challenging, but I have not had a problem.\"\nShe describes the company as supportive, providing her with time to study if she needs it.\n\"We build in workshops and revision classes at weekends and evenings,\" Mr Waite confirms.\n\"It's also thought sensible to give people dedicated time out of their day jobs to prepare for exams,\" he adds.\nHe describes the company as \"industry leading\" in terms of exam pass rates.\nA few weeks into his new career, Nick is positive about the change, despite being apprehensive about the exams\nHe says he often \"dreaded... the extreme workload and general lack of support\" of life as a police officer.\nGetting the new job \"felt like a massive weight had been lifted\".\n\"There are huge differences,\" he says.\n\"The general relationship between seniors and the juniors that are starting out is much more positive, even though the hierarchy is there.\n\"You get a lot more support. Now, I generally look forward to being in work.\"\nMr Waite says the new approach feels right for the company.\n\"I believe we have got a much more interesting cohort of trainees,\" he says.\n\"So you hire people who have interesting stories and interesting backgrounds and are really high performing in many other parts lives, that in previous years we wouldn't have given them the opportunity to tell us about even.\n\"I think part of being a great business adviser is about being able to grow and maintain really strong and deep client relationships, which is on an equal footing with the technical understanding that comes with being a business adviser.\n\"I think the people we are hiring now are able to do both well.\"","37":"The Icelandic star had been trying to manage the polyp, which was discovered by doctors about four years ago, with diets and exercise.\nThe 47-year-old decided this year to undergo laser surgery, after being forced to cancel some performances of her Biophilia show in April.\n\"I have to say, in my case anyway: surgery rocks!\" she wrote online.\n\"I stayed quiet for three weeks and then started singing and definitely feel like my cords are as good as pre-nodule,\" the singer continued.\n\"It's been very satisfying to sing all them clear notes again.\"\nThe performer, whose music career took off with pop group The Sugarcubes, opened her latest world tour in Manchester in July 2011.\nIn October last year she released Biophilia, a concept album about nature with songs inspired by such themes as DNA, tectonic plates and crystals\n\"I'm sorry I had to cancel stuff earlier in the year - didn't want to talk about this until I knew for sure if it would work,\" she wrote.\n\"So looking forward to singing for you in 2013.\"\nBjork joins a number of musicians who have had surgery on polyps - fleshy, non-cancerous growths that usually form on the vocal cords.\nLast year Adele had minor surgery to remove a benign polyp, as did Australian country singer Keith Urban.\nAn operation to remove a small polyp from Dame Julie Andrews' vocal chords in the late 1990s caused serious damage to her voice.\nThe actress later took legal action against two doctors at New York's Mount Sinai hospital.","38":"Stephen Mansbridge, who resigned last year in protest over how the borough council was run, said a DEM would be a real opportunity for the Surrey town.\nCouncillor Tony Rooth said it would be too costly and he could become \"a dictator\".\nA referendum is being held on 13 October to decide the issue.\nThe vote was triggered by a petition signed by 5,269 residents.\nGuildford currently has a ceremonial mayor appointed by the council.\nThere are currently 17 elected mayors in England, including those in London, Bristol and Liverpool.\nGuildford Borough Council said the current leader, Councillor Paul Spooner, receives \u00a322,092 in allowances.\nDEM salaries elsewhere in the country are \u00a365,000 but the council would have to agree a salary on the recommendation of an independent panel.\nThe cost of the referendum is estimated at \u00a3130,000.\n\"I left because I felt that councillors had put in place a system of governance that was weak and that will not deliver the decisions we need for Guildford to get into the 21st Century because its not there yet,\" said Mr Mansbridge.\n\"Guildford is not just another place.

Its flag offers the advantages of easier registration (often online) and the ability to employ cheaper foreign labour. Furthermore the foreign owners pay no income taxes.\nAbout 8,600 ships fly the Panamanian flag. By comparison, the US has around 3,400 registered vessels and China just over 3,700.\nUnder international law, every merchant ship must be registered with a country, known as its flag state.\nThat country has jurisdiction over the vessel and is responsible for inspecting that it is safe to sail and to check on the crew's working conditions.\nOpen registries, sometimes referred to pejoratively as flags of convenience, have been contentious from the start.\nThe first transfer of ships to Panama's register in 1922 involved two US passenger ships wishing to serve alcohol to passengers during Prohibition. More followed as shipowners sought to avoid higher wages and improved working conditions secured through US legislation.\nAfter World War Two, Panama's registry grew more rapidly as US shipowners sought to lower overheads while European ones switched flags to avoid high tax rates.\nAs demand rose for open registration, other countries in the developing world formed their own. The US used Liberia's registry to build a fleet of neutral ships during the Cold War.\nPanama now has the largest registry in the world, followed by Liberia, the Marshall Islands, Hong Kong and Singapore. By last year, almost three quarters of the world's fleet was registered under a flag of a country other than its own.\nThe registry is lucrative for Panama, bringing in half a billion dollars for the economy in fees, services and taxes.\nHowever, critics of the system point to the ease of hiding the true identity of shipowners and the lax enforcement of rules and regulations.\nLuis Fruto, representative of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) in Panama, says the country turns a blind eye to its \"responsibilities in order to acquire higher registration\".\nThe ITF has led a campaign against flags of convenience since 1958. It considers that Panamanian registration is better than some \"from a safety viewpoint, but it remains seriously flawed in areas such as oversight, accident investigation and crew assistance\".\nTwo years ago, Mr Fruto investigated the death of a woman sailor, 22, on her first voyage. She became trapped in machinery that was reportedly faulty and died.\nThe ITF says that, rather than heading for the nearest port as rules dictate, the ship continued to sail for more than two weeks with her body in a freezer.\nFurther investigation by the ITF suggested that some of the shipping certificates had been bought.\nInternational legal requirements insist that countries operating open registries inspect vessels, comply with international regulations and investigate accidents and corruption.\nBut critics say that Panama cuts corners in all these tasks, putting maritime workers at risk.\nIndeed, accidents involving Panamanian-registered ships are high.\nHowever, Carlos Gonzalez, former executive secretary of the Panamanian Maritime Authority, attributes this to a numbers game.\nPanama has the most ships and therefore the most incidents, he says.\nSince 2008, Panama has cut down on enough offences to move up from the black to the white list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, a watchdog comprising 27 maritime administrations from Europe and North America.\nYet Panama's registry is consistently beset by allegations of corruption.\nIn 2000, ITF general secretary David Cockroft was able to buy a Panamanian first officer's certificate for $4,000 to navigate a ship - even though he had no maritime skills or experience.\nDespite repeated assurances that the country was cleaning up its act, Roberto Linares, the head of the Panama Maritime Authority, resigned in June after it was discovered that workers were being certified without the proper qualifications.\n\"The scandal brings us back to the days that Panama was called a 'convenience flag',\" said Franklin Castrellon, former spokesman for the Panama Canal Commission, an independent agency operating the waterway until the country took over from the US in 1999.\nNew leadership plans to turn things around again.\nJorge Barakat, the new head of the maritime authority, said: \"The Panamanian flag is still robust and secure. Whatever kind of non-compliance there is will be reviewed by the administration.\"\nAs a commercial venture, Panama's flag of convenience is a success. But according to the ITF, that comes at a cost.\nIt believes the world economy could survive a ban on flags of convenience and the higher costs that it says would follow.\nITF secretary Jon Whitlow said: \"There would be some reconfiguration. The positive effects would include better protections and safeguards for seafarers who found themselves once again serving on a national flag ship.\"\nShipping prices would rise, but free competition has extensively distorted the market, he says.\nHowever, defenders of the system say this thinking is outdated and that flags of convenience are here to stay.\n\"Panama's registry will last for ever,\" said Jorge Luis Sanchez, professor at the International Maritime University of Panama. \"Those who don't like the open registry can opt to do something else with their ships.\"\nJazmina Rovi, former director of the Panama Maritime Law Association, said unions are better off enforcing uniform standards than eliminating the registry altogether.\nWith the new maritime administrator sworn in last month, it remains to be seen whether Panama will crack down on corruption and safety breaches or continue to live with the taint that still clings to flags of convenience.","43":"Simon Berkowitz, 68, was given a six-year sentence for breaking into a retired couple's home just 16 days after being given early release.\nHis crimes include trying to sell stolen documents in 1992 about Paddy Ashdown's affair with his secretary.\nBerkowitz, from Hove, denied burglary but admitted five counts of using their bank cards fraudulently.\nJudge Francis Gilbert QC told him: \"You do not feel the least bit of sympathy for what you have done.\n\"It is perfectly obvious you have no regrets or remorse whatsoever. Burglary is your chosen way of life.\n\"You are a persistent burglar. You have an appalling record and it is extremely likely you will continue to offend.\"\nAbout two weeks after being freed half way through a five-and-a-half-year sentence, Berkowitz travelled to Devon in search of properties to burgle.\nHe broke in to the home of pensioners John and Ann Searle on Guy Fawkes night last year while they were away on holiday.\nBerkowitz was caught on CCTV when he used Mr Searle's stolen bank cards to obtain \u00c2\u00a31,100 in Sidmouth and Exmouth.\nPolice arrested him in Sidmouth carrying a rucksack containing a burglary kit consisting of metal levers, gaffer tape, two torches and a piece of wire bent into a hook.\nHe denied burgling the house in Hillside Road, Sidmouth and told Exeter Crown Court he had no need to steal because he inherited \u00c2\u00a34,000 from his mother who died during his last jail sentence.\nThe jury took less than an hour to convict him after hearing his list of previous convictions dating back to 1961.","44":"The consumers - the voters - appear to be shrugging off the uncertainties, the unknowns and the warnings of future risks.\nMany economists had predicted that a vote to leave the EU would tip Britain into recession. Instead, after six months, the UK is on track to be the fastest growing economy in the G7. Orders in the manufacturing sector are expanding at the fastest rate in 25 years.\nConsumers are acting \"almost as though the referendum had not taken place\" asserts Andy Haldane, the Chief Economist at the Bank of England.\nThe economic forecasters are on the defensive or taking a turn in the confessional, admitting that the forecasting profession \"is to some extent in crisis\". It is a reminder of what I was once told - that economics is not a science but the politics of money.\nThere have been times in the past when politicians have urged voters to go out and spend, almost as if shopping was a patriotic duty. In recent months, the British consumer has needed no urging.\nWarnings have been defied. Financed by a surge in borrowing, spending is accelerating. Confidence is high, buoyed by real income growth, the housing market outside London, low unemployment and a soaring stock market. Our European neighbours are a little open-mouthed at the way the script is unfolding.\nBut many of the same economists and forecasters who had warned against Brexit still believe a reckoning is coming. The rising costs of imports because of a weakened pound and increased fuel prices will combine to force some retailers to raise their prices. Higher inflation will test consumer appetites.\nThe robust economy has bought the government political space. It is not at the moment under pressure and does not yet need to show its hand but, slowly, a narrative is emerging that carries risks for Theresa May and her tightly-wound circle; that they are hobbled by indecision.\nPerhaps, not surprisingly, you hear it said in the European Commission that the government neither has a strategy for the negotiations ahead nor does it know what it wants.\nThat is seeping into the conversations in Westminster and was boosted by the charge from Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK Ambassador to the EU, of \"muddled thinking\" in the government.\nIt is a narrative rejected by Mrs May and, to be fair to No 10, there are no easy choices. It is as complex a negotiation as any government has faced. Inevitably some people will be disappointed.\nBrussels thinks the UK has made its choice. The PM has said the UK will insist on controlling EU immigration and on leaving the jurisdiction of the European courts. To those sitting in the halls of the EU that means Britain is set on leaving the single market because access to the internal market depends on accepting freedom of movement.\nTheresa May has repeatedly rejected the idea that what the UK wants is a binary decision. She certainly believes that the government has to reassert control over EU migration and that is close to being a red line.\nBut ministers believe that does not preclude a deal, whereby access to the single market is negotiated for certain industries or where some elements of freedom of movement are accepted, while negotiating for the right to apply a brake if the system is under pressure.\nThe official EU line is the one echoed by Angela Merkel who insists there will be \"no cherry picking\". So far, the 27 other members of the EU have been remarkably united behind that response.\nThe government, however, believes that once the negotiations start there will be greater flexibility to be exploited.\nDowning Street knows that almost any deal has the capacity to stir up divisions, not least within the PM's own party. The differences will not easily be reconciled.\nMany of the Brexiteers want to leave the single market and the customs union as quickly as possible, precisely because of the conditions attached to belonging to it.\nHowever, a sizeable part of the Conservative Party, the City and the business community believes that leaving the single market would be reckless, risking serious damage to the UK economy.\nSome time after the end of March, when Article 50 is triggered, the negotiations will begin. The initial focus will be on the terms of the divorce. Early on, the UK will face the bill to settle outstanding obligations, like contributions to the EU budget and towards EU pensions. In Brussels they put the price tag somewhere between 55 and 60 billion euros. That one item alone has the potential to sour negotiations.\nIn the two years to settle the divorce there will almost certainly be no time to agree a trade deal. That is why both the EU and some UK ministers are calling for a transitional arrangement.\nThis will be a much more dangerous period for the government.

Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually.\nMost homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year.\nSuch lenders are unlikely to increase their SVRs until there has been a significant rise in base rates - certainly more than 0.25%.\n\"Lenders with the lowest SVRs - below 5% - are more likely to increase their rates, while those charging more than 5% in many cases won't,\" says Ray Boulger of brokers John Charcol.\nThose with tracker mortgages, which follow base rate, will see inevitable increases.\nThe table below shows what might happen to a notional mortgage, based on the average mortgage rate of 3.11%, rising to 3.36%.\nThere are 2.6 million people on \"interest-only\" mortgages, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Unlike repayment mortgages, which pay off the capital by the end of the term, these mortgages leave borrowers still owing the original sum.\nWhile such people are likely to have lower repayments to begin with, they will soon face proportionately larger increases, if on a tracker rate. Using the same rates as in the table above, someone on a \u00a350,000 mortgage might pay an extra \u00a311 a month, if rates went up by 0.25%.\nSomeone on a \u00a3150,000 interest-only mortgage might pay \u00a331 more.\nAs Mark Carney is fond of reminding us, the rises in base rates will be small, and the pace will be gradual - reaching about 2% over the next three years.\nSo while the impact of the first hike may be small, someone with a mortgage advance of \u00a3150,000 could eventually find themselves paying \u00a3161 a month more, according to figures supplied by the Halifax, Britain's largest lender.\nExperts think it unlikely that existing fixed rates will be withdrawn quickly. But they are unlikely to go any lower. So anyone on a variable or tracker rate may wish to switch to a fixed rate deal.\n'If you are on a variable rate, and would struggle to pay your mortgage if rates rose, it is worth locking into a fixed rate,\" says Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients.\n\"There are some really cheap deals on the market, with two-year fixes starting at 1.05% and five-year fixes from 2.14%,\" he said.\nAfter years of being in the doldrums, savings rates have finally begun to improve. Rates have increased by 10% since June, according to advice site Savingschampion.\nThe prospect of a rate rise before the end of the year is likely to put even more pressure on savings providers to increase rates.\n\"It's been a long time coming and I'm sure I can speak for all savers in saying 'bring it on',\" said Anna Bowes, director of Savingschampion.","58":"But it serves as an important in-depth account of the state of the NHS in England.\nThe opening pages, inevitably, emphasise the positives - just as a corporate annual report would do. Half a million more patients seen in A&E than in the previous year, more than one million appointments booked or cancelled online, an increase in the NHS workforce, almost \u00c2\u00a31bn invested over five years in infrastructure to boost research.\nBut read on and the more difficult truths begin to emerge.\nThe report, covering the 2016-17 financial year, acknowledges that many of the key performance targets were missed, including the proportion of patients assessed or treated in A&E within four hours, which fell further below the 95% target to 89.1%.\nThere is understandable emphasis on the increasing pressures on the service with demand rising \"above what would typically be expected from population growth and demographics alone\" and the NHS delivering record levels of activity.\nLooking for reasons for the drop in hospital performance, the report inevitably gets to the issue of delayed transfers of medically fit patients and the resulting bed shortages. The scale of the problem is underlined by the astonishing 24.5% increase in bed days lost because of these delayed transfers, to 2.3 million from 1.8 million the previous year.  Hospitals were left full to capacity, sometimes unable to admit new patients.\nIt's noted that local authorities are working with health leaders in each area to reduce the numbers of patients held in hospital beds because there is no social care package available. There is a bold statement that \"this will be an area of improvement in 2017-18\".\nThe government has told NHS England that the delayed transfer number must be reduced to 3.5% of total bed occupancy by September. But it's hard to see much progress in that direction so far.\nAn interesting analysis by NHS Providers, due out soon, highlights the continuing scale of the delayed transfer problem. The organisation points out that community hospitals have a far higher proportion of beds occupied by people who are fit to leave (20.8% in February) than the larger acute hospitals (5.1%).\nDelayed transfers can occur when an NHS community facility is unable to take patients from acute care or when either type of NHS hospital can't discharge patients because social care is not available.\nThe research also points out that in March this year there were more than three times as many delayed days due to \"patients awaiting a care package in their own home\" compared with April 2014.\nNHS Providers concludes that the September target of 3.5% of beds occupied by patients whose transfer has been held up is looking highly unrealistic.  That level has not been achieved for nearly three years and the latest quarterly current figure across all NHS hospitals in England was 5.6%.\nThe government has pumped \u00c2\u00a31bn extra into social care in England this year in part to help tackle the causes of the delayed discharges of patients from hospitals. One of the aims is to free up NHS beds to cope with rising emergency admissions and the backlog of routine operations.\nBut with local authorities pointing out that there are many other social care issues to tackle with the money, it's still not clear whether the new funding will make a significant dent in the delayed transfer numbers.\nIt's the height of summer and NHS leaders and politicians are preparing for their holidays. Their minds will not be on bed occupancy and social care.\nThe Department of Health report and the NHS Providers analysis will be parked up in office in-trays and inboxes.

They should find out the result ahead of this week's extraordinary congress meeting in Zurich.\nSexwale, 62, said on Monday he was a \"realist\" over his chances and hinted at striking a deal, adding: \"It's like the Vatican, you never know what will come out.\"\nMeanwhile, Infantino said he hoped to get most of Africa's 54 national votes, despite the Confederation of African Football (CAF) endorsing Sheikh Salman - his fellow frontrunner.\nBoth men were talking at a news conference held together after visiting Robben Island, where Sexwale spent 13 year imprisoned.\nThe vote of up to 209 Fifa member federations takes place with the organisation embroiled a corruption scandal with dozens of senior officials indicted by United States' prosecutors.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMeanwhile, a survey of 25,000 football fans by anti-corruption campaigning organisation Transparency International, found 69% had no confidence in Fifa.\nAnd when asked which of the five presidential candidates was the best man to run Fifa, 60% answered \"none of the above\".\nThe survey, which included supporters from 28 different countries, also found that 43% said their enjoyment of football had been affected by the Fifa corruption scandals.","60":"The government's Major Projects Authority (MPA) has given 32 schemes a red or amber\/red rating, meaning they are deemed unachievable or in doubt.\nRed projects include two \u00a37bn aircraft carriers dogged by delays, and a new passport applications system.\nThe Cabinet Office welcomed the report and said it would lead to improvements.\nThe MPA was established in 2010 with the aim of turning around the civil service's \"lamentable record\" of delivering large schemes.\nIt is currently monitoring the status of projects worth \u00a3350bn and has assessed how likely they are to meet their time, cost and quality targets.\nSource: Major Projects Authority\nIn documents released on Friday, the MPA warned that large portions of that public money could be at risk because of delays and inefficiencies.\nOf 191 programmes assessed, 32 were given the green all-clear rating - meaning successful completion is \"highly likely\" - with 49 classed as amber\/green, meaning success is \"probable\".\nSome 58 were amber - which means success is \"feasible\" but significant issues exist - and 21 were exempt from ranking.\nEight red projects - meaning those deemed \"unachievable\" as a result of budget, schedule or delivery problems - include the refranchising of the West Coast Main Line scheme.\nIn October, the government scrapped its decision to award the \u00a35bn franchise to FirstGroup, meaning Virgin Trains will continue running the service until November 2014, when a new long-term franchise is due to begin.\nAlso among the red projects were: Watchkeeper, a new unmanned aerial vehicle for the Army; a new computer system for the Ministry of Justice; and a new system for the Home Office to manage passport applications.\nBy Alan SoadyPolitical reporter, BBC News\nGovernments have long faced accusations of poorly managing big public projects. Ministers say today's report shows they are being open and honest with taxpayers.\nAnd it's not all bad news - a number of projects are deemed to be fully on-track.\nThe difficulty is that those which come with a warning include some of the most high-profile and expensive commitments.\nThe government is saying there's no cause for alarm. But ministers will now be under even greater pressure to deliver the projects successfully - and prove the fears unfounded.\nSome 23 schemes were given an amber\/red rating, meaning their successful delivery is \"in doubt\" and urgent action needs to be taken.\nThey include some of Work and Pensions Secretary Ian Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, such as the introduction of the Personal Independence Payment - the replacement for Disability Living Allowance - and the controversial benefit cap, limiting the maximum amount any household can receive.\nIn a number of cases highlighted by the MPA - including Universal Credit - the government said the data used to rate the projects was now six to 12 months old and things had improved considerably since then.\nThe HS2 high-speed railway line, linking London with Birmingham and Manchester at a current estimate of \u00a333bn, was also designated amber\/red.\nLast week, the National Audit Office warned the economic benefits of the vast project were unclear.\nCabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said the MPA had already helped to save more than \u00a31.7bn.\nHe said that, when he came into government, there was \"a relaxed approach to managing projects worth hundreds of billions of pounds\" with problems \"swept under the carpet where they festered at the taxpayers' expense\".\nSource: Major Projects Authority\n\"Since the general election we have got things back on track and are equipping the civil servants with the skills they need,\" he said.\nHe added: \"There's much more to do but thanks to the work of excellent officials we now expect to double the success rate of major projects, compared with the figures from 2010.\"\nBut shadow Cabinet Office minister Gareth Thomas told the BBC: \"The most striking thing is just how many huge government projects are off track and are at risk of not being delivered, and the sheer scale of public money that's at risk.\"\nMr Thomas also accused the government of trying to hide the MPA's findings.\n\"It was slipped out at five o'clock on a Friday, when Parliament wasn't sitting, so preventing Members of Parliament from getting to grips with the detail in this report,\" he said.\nAnd Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, also said the timing of the report's release would \"only add to suspicions that the government was trying to bury bad news\".\n\"Alarm bells will now be ringing yet again for taxpayers over central government's ability to deliver value for money on some of its multi-billion pound projects,\" he added.\nData for the latest report was gathered between June and September 2012, and at the time of assessment, some projects were still at the planning stage, others were ongoing, and some were already complete.","61":"Site owner City Property has confirmed the market has been \"partially re-opened\".\nOnly smaller vehicles are being allowed into the site on Thursday evening, although access for HGVs may become possible overnight.\nFirefighters were called to the two-storey Blochairn Fruit Market in the north east of the city when the alarm was raised at 03:44.\nAt the height of the fire widespread flames could be seen across the site and more than 70 firefighters were in attendance.\nWorkers, who had been processing orders and loading vans, were evacuated. There were no reports of any injuries.\nCrews are continuing to hose down the building.\nThe Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said despite extensive damage, much of the building had been saved.\nThe British Hospitality Association had predicted that the blaze would affect local restaurants, flower shops and cafes which rely on daily deliveries from Blochairn.\nCity Property, which owns the site, said it was trying to establish alternative arrangements so that normal business could resume as soon as possible.\nSFRS deputy assistant chief officer John Joyce said: \"What I can tell you is that we've saved a very good proportion of it.\n\"In fact the site operator are pretty happy with the parts that we have saved because that is the main operational part of the building.\n\"It's a real shame for those businesses which have been badly affected, but we're working with the businesses and the city council to get the functioning part open as soon as possible.\"\nHe said a specialist fire investigation team would attempt to establish the cause of the fire in the coming days.\nBBC Scotland understands one line of inquiry being looked at by the fire investigation team is the possibility the fire started in a fridge in the fruit market.\nFish merchant Donald Neilson, the director of John Vallance Ltd, described seeing the fire coming towards them along the roof.\nHe said there had been reports of a small fire at the other end of the market.\nMr Neilson said he had not thought the fire would impact on his the part of the site, and he went to check the fruit market area.\n\"It really was like a raging inferno through there at the far end,\" said Mr Neilson.\n\"I ran back in and shouted to our staff 'everybody get out right now'.\"\nHe said deliveries were left lying and vans were left half-loaded.\n\"The most important thing is everybody got out,\" he said.\nJim McGhee, who owns Castle Douglas fruit and veg shop Mitchell's, was also there when the fire broke out.\n\"I was in the market at 02:30 this morning - I had been there for about an hour and the fire alarms went off,\" he said.\n\"Within 10 minutes the fire had spread right through the bottom end of the market and gas cylinders were exploding.\n\"It was really quite bad.\"\nHe said it had been quite easy to walk out of the warehouse, and that the fire brigade had been on the scene \"really quickly\".\nInitially, emergency services were being hampered in their efforts to put out the fire due to low water pressure caused by the number of appliances tackling the blaze.\nScottish Water was contacted and took steps to boost the water pressure in the area.\nInsp Stuart Clemenson, from Police Scotland, told BBC Scotland the building had been still well ablaze three hours after the fire started.\nHe said: \"The site itself employs approximately 400 people who have now all evacuated out.\"\nSFRS said 12 fire engines and four aerial appliances had been involved in the operation.\nPolice Scotland said Blochairn Road between Royston Road and Siemens Place had been closed due to the fire. Local diversions were in place.\nA large plume of smoke from the building led to speed restrictions put in place for drivers on the nearby M8 motorway. This was later lifted.\nHundreds of traders work at the market, supplying fresh fruit and vegetables and fish to shops and restaurants in the west of the country.","62":"The news comes as frustrated Berkshire residents hit by the 2014 floods say \"not a lot has happened\" so far to stop the river from overflowing again.\nThe section from Datchet in Berkshire to Teddington in London needs \u00a3300m for a flood channel and weir improvements.\nThe Environment Agency said a lot of work had been done since last year.\nEast Berkshire was one of the areas worst hit in the UK by the flooding in February 2014.\nRoyal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead councillor for Wraysbury, Colin Rayner, said in 18 months \"not a lot has happened apart from lots of talk, paperwork and lots of schemes\".\nHe said: \"I believe not one bit of the River Thames has been dredged since the floods, and no improvements made to the weirs.\n\"My fear is that we might be in the same place again if we have heavy rains again.\"\nDavid Murphy, who heads up the flood alleviation project at the Environment Agency, said the scheme was actually \"progressing really well\".\nHe said, as well as repairing all the affected flood defences, the agency had \"carried out site and ground investigation works along the proposed route of the flood channel\".\nHe said funding had been found for the first phase of the scheme, which looks at development and design of the flood channel.\nBut he added that another \"\u00a345m to \u00a350m\" was needed for the construction phase of the scheme.\n\"We're looking at a number of sources from European funds to local levies,\" he said.\nThe River Thames scheme includes work to construct a flood channel and improve three of the existing Thames weirs.\nConstruction of the flood channel is expected to start in 2020 and is expected to take about five years to complete.","63":"Ennere's eyes are watering. Smoke from the fire she is cooking on is filling her tiny, one-room house in a small village in the district of Chikwawa in the south of Malawi.\nIt is a traditional open fire on the floor of her hut, surrounded by three bricks to keep in the hot embers and on which to rest her cooking pot.\nShe and her two-year old daughter, who is gripping Ennere's shoulder as she crouches over a warming pan of water, are breathing in the smoke.\nMost of the small houses here have no chimney. Some of the smoke escapes through the doorway, but there is no other ventilation. Smoke is filling the little girl's lungs.\nThis happens every time Ennere cooks.\nLike 95% of people in Malawi, her family belong to what the World Health Organization calls the \"forgotten three billion\", people who have to breathe polluted air in their homes and are being poisoned by their own cooking fires.\n\"Smoke basically clogs up children's lungs making them more susceptible to infections like pneumonia, explains Dr Kevin Mortimer, one of the lead researchers from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\nIn Malawi, pneumonia is the number one killer of children under five.\nAccording to the WHO, throughout sub-Saharan Africa, almost one million children every year die from the disease.  Worldwide that number could be more than four million.\nRedesigning the stove on which millions cook, the researchers believe, could be the solution to cutting this death toll.\nThere are several different types of clean cook stove. The ones the team are testing use the same fuel as open fires, wood (or biomass) but they incorporate a battery-powered fan that blows air through a contained furnace.\nThis produces a more efficient, less smoky fire.\nThe Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine team intends to distribute 16,000 stoves in the north of Malawi, and here in Chikwawa in the south. It will be the largest trial of its type ever undertaken anywhere in the world.\nEnnere and her daughter have been recruited to the control group, meaning they will continue to use conventional cooking methods over a traditional open fire.\nThat might seem unfair, but it will allow researchers to compare their \"stove intervention\" with routine, smoky cooking practices.\nAt the end of the two-year study, during which the researchers will monitor the health of each child, every family involved will receive two of the cleaner, \"advanced-burning\" stoves.\nIf this team finds that the stoves they are testing prevent pneumonia, Dr Mortimer says this will be a definitive message for Malawi's government, and policymakers around the world, that this is a priority for their investment.\nAt the nearby Chikwawa District Hospital, the toll that lung disease takes here becomes clear.\nChifundo Ndamala is one of the clinical staff working for the research project, providing care for children involved in the study, as well as recording and tracking every case of pneumonia.\nAs Dr Mortimer puts it: \"We're interested in counting cases of pneumonia, not dead children.\"\nFor that reason, the team has employed health workers and invested in diagnostic tools and antibiotics, so every child in the study has access to the treatment they need if they do become ill.\nChifundo is attending to one of the children from the control group - a young boy of about two.\nHe smiles warmly at the little boy as he examines him, but the toddler is wide-eyed and clings to his mother as they sit together on the bare mattress of the hospital bed.\n\"He was diagnosed with severe pneumonia three months ago,\" Chifundo tells me. \"But he's doing well, he's responding to treatment now.\"\nThis is a country where healthcare is basic - there are approximately 50,000 people for every doctor in Malawi. And staff here in the children's ward have to work with the few resources they have to care for their young patients, some of whom are critically ill.\nBut this project does mean that Chifundo is on hand to help.\n\"This is not a place of comfort,\" says Dr Mortimer, \"but it is a place where people are doing their utmost to provide the best possible care with the resources they have.\"\nChifundo is even more optimistic.\n\"We're able to treat children who will be the leaders of this nation one day,\" he says.\n\"It's rewarding job; just seeing a child recover and go home, it's good for the soul.\"\nDr Mortimer also hopes the study and the eventual publication of its findings will \"raise the profile\" of indoor smoke exposure.\n\"People should know,\" he says, \"that this is a condition that causes millions of deaths every year\".","64":"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider working with Russia in some areas but would stand up for its own interests.\nMeanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow.\nUS President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow.\nBut the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign.\nUS intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election.\nRex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man.\nSo far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a \"Good Morning, y'all\" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany.\nSo we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth.\n\"Good try,\" Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond.\nHe did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work\nAnd three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week.\nMr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job.\nHe said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments.\n\"As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people,\" he said.\n\"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies.\nThe secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region.\nRussia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014.\nMr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where \"terrorism has put down roots\".\nHowever, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago.\nMr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions.\nMr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil.\nAt a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to \"restore co-operation with the Pentagon\".\n\"We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward,\" he told reporters.\nThe defence secretary said that Russia had to abide by international law, adding that there was \"little doubt\" that Moscow had interfered or attempted to interfere in several Western elections.","65":"The US boaters were part of the Port Huron Float Down, an annual event on the St. Clair River, which divides the US state of Michigan and Canada.\nPolice in Sarnia, Ontario, said it took hours to transport the stranded revellers back to the US on Sunday.\nNo arrests were made and no one was injured, according to police.\nThe unsanctioned event - in which participants float down the river on rafts, inner tubes and other flotation devices - begins at Port Huron's Lighthouse Beach in Michigan and was supposed to end at Chrysler Beach in Marysville.\nBut hundreds of people were not prepared for the strong winds and challenging weather conditions, which blew about 1,500 people out of American waters and over the border.\nSarnia Police Service Staff Sgt Scott Clarke told the Times Herald newspaper that participants \"were unprepared to be stranded anywhere,\" adding that many were not equipped with life jackets.\n\"It was a bit of a nightmare, but we got through it,\" Mr Clarke said. \"There were long waits and long lines.

be it criminals or law enforcement - if they are intercepted.\nThis adds valuable security to the messages we send online, which could contain private information, bank details and personal photographs.\nSome apps such as WhatsApp already add end-to-end encryption to messages automatically.\nHowever, this does mean that theoretically messages can be sent that police or other authorities cannot read if they intercept them.\nOn Sunday, Mrs May said there should be no messages that law enforcement \"cannot read\", while Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she wanted tech companies to \"limit the use of end-to-end encryption\".\nCritics say disabling encryption in popular apps will not deter criminals - they could simply switch from one app to another, or create their own messaging apps.\nMeanwhile, messages sent by law-abiding citizens would become \"easy for criminals, voyeurs and foreign spies to intercept\", journalist and former digital rights activist Cory Doctorow wrote in a blog.\nCyber-security experts are particularly critical of the notion that messaging apps should have a \"back door\" in their systems, to let authorities read users' messages.\n\"It's impossible to overstate how bonkers the idea of sabotaging cryptography is to people who understand information security,\" said Mr Doctorow.\n\"Use deliberately compromised cryptography, that has a back door that only the 'good guys' are supposed to have the keys to, and you have effectively no security.\"\nEven if app-makers were ordered to stop using encryption, it would be very difficult to stop criminals encrypting their messages manually, or writing them in code.\nOn Sunday, Mrs May said large internet companies provided a \"safe space\" for extremist ideology to breed.\nEarlier this year, a Home Affairs Select Committee report said social networks were \"shamefully far\" from tackling illegal and dangerous content and took too long to remove offending posts.\nThe volume of material uploaded to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social networks is astonishing, making it difficult to moderate.\nYouTube says 400 hours worth of video are uploaded to its platform every minute, making it impossible to review every clip a user posts.\nThe Open Rights Group, which campaigns for online freedoms, said governments and companies should \"take sensible measures to stop abuse\" but warned that \"attempts to control the internet\" would be difficult to enforce.\nTechnology companies have defended their handling of extremist content following the London terror attack.\nYouTube told the BBC that it received 200,000 reports of inappropriate content a day, but managed to review 98% of them within 24 hours.\nIt said hate speech made up a small proportion of the \"tens of millions\" of videos it removed every year.\nFacebook said: \"Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it - and if we become aware of an emergency involving imminent harm to someone's safety, we notify law enforcement.\"\nIt said it actively worked to identify extremist accounts and worked with rivals Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to help identify such content.\nBoth Facebook and Google have stated that extremist content has no place on their websites.\nGermany has tried to further motivate internet giants, by threatening them with fines of up to 50m euros (\u00c2\u00a343.5m) if they fail to remove hate speech quickly.\nHowever, the Open Rights Group warned that tough regulation by governments \"could push these vile networks into even darker corners of the web, where they will be even harder to observe\".","68":"Heidi Agan, 32, now has a \"bump made in various sizes\", she said.\nThe single mother-of-two from Corby, Northamptonshire quit her job at a Kettering restaurant last May after customers repeatedly said she looked like Kate Middleton.\nShe now travels across the UK and around the world to make appearances as a royal doppelganger.\n\"To have done 12 years of something you know and then to leap into an industry that gives with one hand and takes with another is difficult, but I'm just really happy and feel blessed that I did,\" she said.\nSince the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge announced their forthcoming baby, lookalike Ms Agan has now prepared to appear with child.\n\"As Kate grows I will too -

After all, the retail sales figures are very volatile on a month-by-month basis. And the heatwave in June provided a boost to clothing sales that may not be sustained,\" said Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics.\nOther economists argue the figures should have been even stronger.\n\"Last month was the fifth warmest June since 1910, and food and clothing sales usually surge when the temperature is unusually high in the summer,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\"The increase in retail sales in June was relatively modest, given the temporary support to demand from the unusually warm weather.\"\nEconomists are keeping a close eye on spending by UK shoppers as it has been supporting the overall economy.\nBut with inflation now running ahead of wage growth, there have been concerns of a slowdown in spending.\n\"The outlook of falling real wages and tightening credit conditions suggest that retail sales will struggle to retain Q2's vigour in the second half of this year,\" Mr Tombs said.\nNext week, figures will be released on second quarter growth in the UK.

Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men.\nStatistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive.\nA 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one.\nOthers put the ratio at 16-to-one.\nA more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one.\nBut there is growing evidence that more girls and women have the condition than was originally thought and that it is being significantly under-diagnosed.\nWe met Millie at home in Norfolk.\nShe wears a weighted jacket - it helps to calm her mood, she stands to do everything, she finds it hard to socialise, to make eye contact, to form relationships.\n\"I find it really difficult to make friends, because I find people really, really difficult,\" she says.\n\"I find it hard to understand people a lot in the way that they feel or what they mean, and this leads me to feel embarrassed, and I feel like I should get out of everyone's way just for convenience.\"\nMillie, 14, was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome two years ago.\nIt came as a relief.\n\"It made my life easier because then I could say, 'This is the way I am.'\n\"I know that sometimes I can be a bit of a problem, but I'm not intending to do it.\n\"It's just the way my brain works.\"\nWhy are fewer girls and women diagnosed with the condition?\nExperts believe it may be because girls are better at masking the symptoms - better at copying social norms while not necessarily understanding them.\nEmily, 29, works at the National Autistic Society.\n\"When you meet me, I don't come across necessarily on first glance as being autistic,\" she says.\n\"I will come into work perfectly, get through the day perfectly, and then I'll go home to a quiet dark room.\n\"I'll be non-verbal, so I won't be able to speak, won't be able to communicate and will take about four hours to reset.\"\nThe anxiety of coping with day-to-day life led to a series of what Emily calls meltdowns and shutdowns.\nShe was misdiagnosed with a series of mental health problems - bipolar, borderline personality disorder - and given treatments she says made things worse.\nHer diagnosis of autism last year changed everything.\n\"It was basically an instant turning point,\" she says.\n\"I'm a radically different person.\n\"I understand who I am and how my way of relating to the world might differ, so I can make that something that's successful.\"\nThere is another reason many girls and women may be missing from the statistics.\nThe diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders has largely been based on the behavioural characteristics of boys and men.\nCharities are now campaigning for changes, to recognise the more nuanced way girls and women may present with the condition.\nThat is what has just happened in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which produces clinical practice guidelines for the NHS in Scotland, published new guidance in July.\nConsultant psychiatrist Iain McClure, who helped draw up the guidelines, says there is growing evidence showing differences in how males and females with autism present.\n\"A teenage girl with autism might for example be integrated into a peer group, and often they're talking about how they're pretending to be normal,\" he says.\n\"They're trying to fit in with the group and they are following the same sort of interest that the peer group have got but perhaps in a more bizarre or unusual way.\n\"So, when you actually get into the detail, you start to see how this problem is more camouflaged but still subtly present.\"\nIain McClure is convinced there are many women and girls who are developing mental health problems, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, because their actual condition is not being spotted.\n\"I keep seeing patients who have got autism, but we didn't know they had it,\" he says.\n\"What's happened is they've developed a kind of burnout.\n\"So, it's really important to try and recognise these difficulties as early as possible.\n\"Knowledge is power - if you understand a problem you can do something about it.\"\nBack in Norfolk, Millie helps her father, Roger, in the garden.\nThere's no history of autism in the family, and Roger says they went through a series of emotions when the diagnosis was made - confusion, shock, denial and finally acceptance.\nWiping away tears, he tells me: \"With that acceptance,  you come to realise the really good points.\n\"Millie looks at the world in a completely different way and picks up on things that I can't.\n\"It's a shame that not enough people understand the condition. And my concern more than anything else is that when Millie's older, people are not going to see what I see.\"\nMillie is now getting concentrated, targeted help and is doing well at school.\nThe call today from the National Autistic Society is for the diagnosis of girls and women to change and improve so many more can also get the help they need.","72":"The army accused Pakistan of mutilating the bodies in Monday's clash on the Line of Control - claims the Pakistani army denied.\nBut Indians, including the mourning families of the soldiers, feel Pakistan \"should be taught a lesson\".\nIndian PM Narendra Modi has also been criticised for \"not taking any action\".\nMonika, the daughter of head constable Prem Sagar, said she wanted Indian forces to kill at least 10 Pakistani troops to avenge her father.\nMany on social media have shared similar sentiments using the hashtag badlalo (take revenge).\nSome anger has also been directed at Mr Modi, making #ModiWeakestPMever one of the top trending hashtags in India on Tuesday.\nOthers have pointed out that Mr Modi was yet to appoint a full-time defence minister after Manohar Parrikar left the post to become the chief minister of the coastal state of Goa.\nIndia's finance minister Arun Jaitley, who is also in charge of the defence ministry, said the incident was \"reprehensible and inhuman\".\n\"Such acts are unheard of even during wars and definitely never in peace time,\" he said in a statement broadcast on Indian television.\n\"The entire country has full faith in the army that they will give the appropriate response.\"\nBut Pakistan rejected the allegation, saying its army \"was a highly professional force\" and it would \"never disrespect a soldier, even Indian\".\n\"Indian blame of mutilating Indian soldiers' bodies are also false,\" it said.\nClaimed by both countries, Kashmir has been a flashpoint for more than  60 years.\nKashmir - the region at the heart of dispute\nIndia soldier 'beheaded' in Kashmir\nMeanwhile, authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have cancelled by-elections for a parliamentary seat following violence in the state.\nThe situation has been tense in the region since security forces clashed with protesters during another by-election on 9 April.\nEight killed in Kashmir poll violence\nMan tied to car 'to shield army' - BBC News\nKashmir social media ban criticised\nAt least eight people died and scores suffered injuries in the clashes.\nParamilitary forces fired bullets and shotgun pellets as people protesting against Indian rule stormed polling stations near the capital, Srinagar.\nSeparatist leaders had called for a boycott of the vote.","73":"Davis said some players had \"thrown in the towel\" following the League One strugglers' 3-0 loss at London Road.\n\"When the manager starts questioning your effort, that's what hurts the most,\" Fox, 32, told BBC Radio Stoke.\n\"But he's bang on - the performance left a lot of questions open and we have to try and put it right.\"\nCrewe's fifth defeat in a row leaves the Alex now 15 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table with just six games left and facing a near-impossible task of avoiding relegation.\nFox knows the situation is extremely difficult and says he is desperate for the team to at least show more character until the end of the season. \"We're going down with a whimper at the moment and that hurts the most,\" he added.\n\"If results mean we go down at some point, at least go out fighting. It hurts your pride, it hurts your credibility. Every minute of every day it gets to you and that's how it should be.\"\nCrewe face the short trip to local rivals Port Vale on Saturday knowing that defeat would almost certainly send them down. And Fox, who admits that \"home truths\" had been said in meetings with the manager this week, would not blame Davis if he decided to make radical changes.\n\"If the manager makes 11 changes on Saturday, I don't think anyone could argue with that,\" he said. \"There's 20-odd players that realistically could all play.\n\"The manager's within his rights to play anyone now. You've got to put in a performance to prove you can play. I've got a lot of mates who are Port Vale fans, so I'd love to put one over them.

They will be targeting us.\"\nIf Wilson is selected again at number eight, his opposite number is likely to be Connacht's veteran talisman John Muldoon, a player the Ulster man has the height of respect for.\n\"He's a good bloke. A great talisman for them and leads the team really well so I'll be looking forward to playing against him.\"\nThere was no further news on Tuesday from Ulster on the apparent elbow infection which caused Iain Henderson to be a late withdrawal from Saturday's narrow win over the Ospreys.\nIt also remains to be seen whether Tommy Bowe could be handed a start after making his first appearance of the season following a long spell out because of injury when he came on as a second-half replacement last weekend.","75":"Earlier, the space agency released the most detailed picture yet as it hurtled towards the dwarf planet on Tuesday.\nThe probe was set to grab more images and other data as it passed just 12,500km from the little world at 11:50 GMT (12:50 BST).\nThe spacecraft is currently out of contact with Earth as it continues its observations.\nBut scientists already have colour data from the approach and said they might release another new picture of Pluto later on Tuesday.\nImages set to be released on Wednesday will be more than 10 times the resolution of those already published.\nNew Horizons' flyby of 2,370km-wide Pluto is a key moment in the history of space exploration.\nIt marks the fact that all nine objects considered by many to be the Solar System's planets  - from Mercury through to Pluto - have now been visited at least once by a probe.\n\"We have completed the initial reconnaissance of the Solar System, an endeavour started under President Kennedy more than 50 years ago and continuing to today under President Obama,\" said the mission's chief scientist, Alan Stern.\n\"It's really historic what the US has done, and the New Horizons team is really proud to have been able to run that anchor leg and make this accomplishment.\"\nTalking about the main image of Pluto that was returned just before the flyby began, Nasa's science chief, John Grunsfeld, said: \"This is true exploration... that view is just the first of many rewards the team will get. Pluto is an extraordinarily complex and interesting world.\"\nThe information that has been acquired in recent weeks on approach to the dwarf world will be as nothing to the huge number of observations captured during the flyby. But scientists have already been attempting to interpret the data and images so far.\nDr Stern said: \"On the surface we see a history of impacts, we see a history of surface activity in terms of some features we might be able to interpret as tectonic - indicating internal activity on the planet at some point in its past,  and maybe even in its present.\n\"This is clearly a world where geology and atmosphere - climatology - play a role. Pluto has strong atmospheric cycles. It snows on the surface. These snows sublimate - (and) go back into the atmosphere - every 248-year orbit.\"\nThe team also released two stretched colour images, of Pluto and its main moon, Charon.  The treatment allows scientists to discern more easily some of the differences at the surface of the bodies in terms of composition and processing.\nNew Horizons is investigating not only Pluto and Charon, but also the four smaller moons in the system: Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.\nTo achieve that, it has had to perform a furious set of manoeuvres during the flyby, pointing every which way in the sky to lock on to the different targets.\nThe cheering and jubilation are phenomenal. There's a powerful sense of achievement at sending a robotic craft three billion miles to Pluto. But there's also something much more instinctive: the thrill of witnessing and sharing a great moment of discovery.\nMost moving for me has been catching a few words with the son of the man who first found Pluto. Al Tombaugh is obviously delighted that a sample of his father Clyde's ashes is on board New Horizons, speeding past Pluto and now heading into the unexplored realm of the Kuiper Belt.\nI asked Al if his father would have wanted to visit the tiny world. Maybe, he said, but he was always worried about the physical strain of life as an astronaut. Another thought that's very striking here today: so many scientists and engineers and technicians have had a hand in making this mission work, and their excitement is totally justified.\nSo what about the coming hours? No one here will truly relax until the next signals reach home as the spacecraft slips beyond Pluto.\nNew Horizons' call home after the flyby is due at 00:53 GMT Wednesday (01:53 BST). It will come through a giant dish in Madrid, Spain - part of Nasa's Deep Space Network of communications antennas.\nThis signal will contain only engineering information on the status of the probe, but controllers should be able to tell very quickly whether the flyby sequence worked properly or not.\nThere is a very small possibility that New Horizons could be lost as it flies through the Pluto system.\nAny stray icy debris would have been lethal if it had collided with the spacecraft at its 14km\/s velocity (31,000mph).\n\"Hopefully it did [survive],\" said Alan Stern, \"but there is a little bit of drama.\"\nThe first high-resolution pictures from the pass should be downlinked later on Wednesday.\nThe BBC will be screening a special Sky At Night programme called Pluto Revealed on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter.","76":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nAn, ranked 132 in the world, finished on 21 under par, six shots clear of Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (67) and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee (69).\nEngland's Chris Wood (66) was fourth on 13 under, one shot clear of Italy's Francesco Molinari (74), who was tied for the lead with An overnight.\nThe 23-year-old An's win is his first on one of the world's major tours.\nAn was the youngest-ever winner of the US Amateur Championship in 2009, at the age of 17.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe became only the third European Tour rookie to win the prestigious PGA Championship in its 60-year history and his 267 total over four rounds also beat the tournament record by two shots.\nHis victory, the first time the European Tour's flagship event has been won by an Asian, will see him climb into the world's top 60, secured his place in the US Open and Open Championship and a five-year exemption in Europe.\n\"It's going to be life changing,\" said An, the son of two Olympic table-tennis medallists - his mother Jiao Zhimin represented China and his father Ahn Jae Hyung competed for South Korea.\n\"This is the biggest event on the European Tour and there are a lot of benefits.

That policy was criticised by Conservatives as destined to \"force up rents\", reduce investment in housing and lead to poorer-quality accommodation.\nOn Monday, the Green Party will announce a policy to cap annual rent increases to inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, as part of a package of measures aimed at making the private rented sector fairer for tenants.\nLeader Natalie Bennett will say: \"As it stands, the private rental market is structured in a way that benefits landlords over tenants, and treats homes as investment vehicles. As more people rent, rather than own, their homes, it is vital that we correct this imbalance.\"\nThe Conservatives made an extension of right to buy - the scheme offering council house tenants the chance to buy their home at a discount - to about 1.3m people who live in housing association accommodation a key feature of their manifesto.\nThey are also pledging discounted homes for first-time buyers and a \u00a31bn fund to \"unlock\" sites for 400,000 brownfield homes.\nThe Lib Dems say they would increase housebuilding to 300,000 a year and help young people living with their parents to raise cash for a housing deposit.","83":"The three firms will collaborate on the systems needed to make cars that can navigate without any help from a human driver.\nThe vehicles will be capable of driving safely along major roads as well as in suburban and inner city areas.\nBMW said it hoped the collaboration would mean it could put robot cars into production by 2021.\nThe research partnership was announced on the day when US officials begin an investigation into a fatal car crash involving a Tesla Model S, to which self-driving technology could have contributed.\nBMW said the trio would develop computer and sensor systems that gradually reduce the part humans play in driving a car. Ultimately, it said, it hoped to produce vehicles that could operate entirely autonomously without any people onboard.\nAchieving this, said BMW, would make it possible for fleets of unmanned vehicles to operate safely. This, it added, could spur the creation of novel ride-sharing services in urban areas or lead to the creation of long-distance delivery services that employ robot-driven trucks.\nIn a statement, the three firms said they were \"convinced that automated driving technologies will make travel safer and easier\".\nThey pledged to make the results of the research available to other car makers and electronics firms to help standardise technologies used in autonomous vehicles.\nEarly work would focus on a \"highly automated driving\" prototype which BMW said it planned to demonstrate this year. More extensive tests of this technology across lots of vehicles were planned for 2017, it added.\nThe autonomous car that emerges from the partnership would be likely to be electric and called the iNext, it said. Other vehicles in the i-range include the i8 hybrid and the i3 all-electric vehicle.\nBefore now, BMW has shown off concept cars that use autonomous technology and it is already working with Baidu in China to produce a self-driving car suited to that market.","84":"The claim: The government's figures on business rates are misleading because they exclude inflation and an appeals adjustment.\nReality Check verdict: The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.\nThe overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral.\nBut there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: \"Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.\"\nThe inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.\nBut the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won.\nAnalysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.\nThey add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed.\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.\nSpeaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, \"might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills\".\nThis is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.\nThe government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.\nRead more from Reality Check","85":"He vowed to form a federal police unit to deal with violence against women.\nThe girl, 16, believes she was doped after going to her boyfriend's house last Saturday and says she woke up in a different house, surrounded by 30 men.\nHundreds of protesters on Friday demanded an end to sexual violence.\nThe video of the attack was put on social media, shocking Brazil.\nPolice are hunting more than 30 male suspects.

Watch me roll.\"\nHowever, AshleysAR's full, unedited quote on Twitter reads: \"I hear Tottenham's going coco-bananas right now. Watch me roll up with a spud gun :|\".\nSuddenly the tone of the message becomes markedly less sinister. Ashley later threatens to join in with a water pistol.\nDespite the claim of Tottenham MP David Lammy that the riots were \"organised on Twitter\", there is little evidence of their orchestration on the site's public feeds.\nLooking back through Saturday night's postings, DanielNothing's stream offers some promise of substantiating the theory with his comment: \"Heading to Tottenham to join the riot! who's with me? #ANARCHY\".\nBut it is followed soon after by: \"Hang on, that last tweet should've read 'Curling up on the sofa with an Avengers DVD and my missus, who's with me?' What a klutz I am!\"\nAnother user - Official Grinz - appears to have been the first person to tweet the words \"Westfield riot\", referring to the west London shopping centre. Although his message seems to be tongue in cheek and there is nothing to suggest that he was more than observer, commenting on events as they unfolded on television.\nThe subject of a Westfield riot became widely discussed, but ultimately failed to materialise in the real world.\nSo why is the ratio of apparent incitement to action so low?\nFreddie Benjamin, a research manager at Mobile Youth, believes that much of the online noise is just that.\n\"Once someone starts posting on a BBM group or Twitter, a lot of young people try to follow the trend,\" he told BBC News.\n\"They might not join the actual event, but they might talk about it or use the same hashtag which makes it sound like there is a lot more volume.\"\nSuch postings build what Mr Benjamin refers to as \"social currency\", elevating the messenger's sense of belonging to a group.\nAway from Twitter's very visible feeds, there are perhaps more credible reports that rioters were using private communication systems to encourage others to join the disorder.\nFollowing Saturday's trouble in Tottenham, a number of BlackBerry users reported receiving instant messages that suggested future riot locations.\nBlackBerry's BBM system is known to be the preferred means of communication among many younger people.\nUsers are invited to join each other's contacts list using a unique PIN, although once they have done so, messages can be distributed to large groups.\nBBM is both private and secure, partly due to the phones' roots as business communication devices.\nFor that reason it is hard to evaluate how much information was coming out of the riots or how many people were suggesting alternative targets.\nBut despite the closed nature of BlackBerry Messenger, police may still have a chance to examine some of the communications that took place.\nResearch in Motion, which makes Blackberry phones, issued a statement in which it promised to work with the authorities.\nIt pointed out that, like other telecoms companies, it complies with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) which allows law enforcement to gain access to private messages when they relate to the commission of a crime.\nWhat will concern investigators most is the extent to which recipients acted on any messages sent out.\nDr Chris Greer, a senior lecturer in sociology and criminology at London's City University believes that smartphones will have aided those involved, but are unlikely to have persuaded reluctant recruits to join the rioting.\n\"I don't think it is having any impact on the motivation to protest in the first place,\" he said.\n\"But once people have mobilised themselves and decided to take to the streets it is certainly much easier to communicate with each other.\"\nDr Greer pointed to the example of the 2009 G20 riots in London.\nA report into the police handling of the protests, produced by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMRC) found that technology had aided the rioters more than the police, he explained.\n\"Their methods of communicating with each other or pointing out where the police were at any given time and therefore where the protesters shouldn't be, and basically organising themselves was so much more sophisticated than the police.\"\nIt may turn out, after a more careful examination of the various messages being pinged around, that this was indeed a social networking crime spree.\nThe Met has indicated it is ready to act on any information it finds.\nBut that will take time and a more methodical study.\nThe extent to which investigators are able to sift out genuine rioters from the internet 'echo chamber' and then bring real world prosecutions will provide valuable lessons, both about the use and abuse of technology, and also law enforcement's capacity to deal with it.","91":"The Consumer Rights Act 2015 will make it far easier for groups of consumers to seek compensation from firms that have fixed prices and formed cartels.\nIt introduces \"opt out\" actions where everyone affected is automatically a member of the \"class\" which is suing.\nConsumer groups say it is a huge step forward in helping secure compensation.\nPreviously, when groups of consumers or small and medium-sized businesses wanted to take action against companies who fixed the price of goods or services, on - for example - replica football shirts or air fares, it was very difficult.\nAll of those affected had ether had to \"opt in\" to the action or bring a claim in their own name.  As individual losses were small and legal costs and risks high, few did.\nSuch were the problems with opt-in actions that there has only been one of note. This was when consumer body Which? sued JJB Sports which had taken part in fixing the prices of some replica football shirts.\nThe action was settled and consumers who joined it who had paid up to \u00c2\u00a339.99 for certain England and Manchester United football shirts, during specific periods in 2000 or 2001, received a payment of \u00c2\u00a320 each.\nJJB Sports also agreed to compensate those who bought one of the shirts but did not join the claim.\nThey were entitled to \u00c2\u00a310 if they presented either proof of purchase or the shirt itself, with its label intact, at a JJB Sports store.\nIt was all a bit messy and many who bought the shirts did not join the claim and so did not get any money back.\nUnder the new law, everyone who purchased the overpriced goods can be automatically \"in\" the claim unless they opt out.\nIt means there will be strength in numbers and consumers could get their money back without lifting a finger.\n\"The new collective redress rules will give consumers more power against unscrupulous businesses that have been found guilty of anti-competitive practices,\" said Which? executive director Richard Lloyd.\n\"Now everyone who has been affected will be automatically included so more people should get redress and sooner.\"\nHe added the move was good news for consumers and responsible businesses because \"those caught acting illegally will be made to pay the price\".\nUnder the new law, claims have to be approved by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.\nThey can be brought by a suitable representative of the group affected by the price fixing, who then advertises the claim in order to make others in the group aware of it and would then distribute the money. Any residue goes to charity.\nTwo kinds of claims can be brought.\nFirstly, so-called \"follow on\" claims that follow a competition regulator's finding that there has been an infringement of competition law.\nSecondly, \"standalone\" claims which are not based on an infringement decision. This frees up claimants to seek damages for any competition law violations - not just those the regulators have chosen to pursue.\nIn the US, class actions are far more widespread with damages awards running into billions of dollars.\nThey are not confined to cases where companies get together and fix prices.\nClaims against retailers and manufacturers relating to faulty goods and services can also be brought.\nClass actions have been filed in the US by groups of consumers affected by the recent Volkswagen emission test scandal.\nIn the US, juries hear the cases and set the damages, which can then be trebled by the judge.\nSo, will the new regime really see US-style class actions with huge pay outs?\n\"The regime incorporates a number of safeguards against what are perceived to be the 'excesses' of the US system,\" said Anna Morfey, a specialist competition law solicitor with the London firm Hausfeld.\n\"In particular, the fact that the losing party is typically required to pay the winner's costs acts as a deterrent to frivolous claims in the UK.\n\"But there are other important differences - no treble or 'exemplary' damages, and no jury trials of these claims in the UK, will mean damages awards really are compensatory and not windfalls for claimants.\"\nWhat is clear is that companies who fix prices now face a much greater risk of being sued by all of those who have paid the inflated prices.\nThe Competition Appeal Tribunal decides whether the \"class representative\" is representative of anybody else who would want to sue\nSafeguards to prevent frivolous claims include strict conditions to be met before a claim is approved as \"opt-out\" as opposed to \"opt-in\"; and rules governing damages and costs\n\"Opt-out\" provisions only apply to UK-domiciled consumers or companies.","92":"The ex-UK foreign secretary and former Deputy PM Nick Clegg are among those barred from entering the country.\nThe EU has imposed sanctions on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.\n\"It shows we are making an impact because they wouldn't have reacted unless they felt very sore at what had happened,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Once sanctions were extended, it's had a major impact on the Russian economy.\"\nThe EU, which initially imposed the sanctions after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014 and has subsequently extended them, has called the ban \"totally arbitrary and unjustified\" and said no explanation had been provided.\nA Russian foreign ministry official would not confirm the names of those banned but did say that the ban was result of the European Union's sanctions against the country.\nBritish intelligence and military chiefs, including MI5 director general Andrew Parker, former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers and chief of the defence staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton are reportedly also on the list.\nSir Malcolm said: \"This has happened at a time when the oil price has collapsed and therefore a main source of revenue for Mr Putin has disappeared.\n\"That's pretty important when it comes to his attempts to build up his military might and to force his neighbours to do what they're told.\n\"I understand that they would like the sanctions removed, I want them removed and want to see good relations with Russia.\n\"It's very important that Russia, Britain and western Europe as a whole work amicably together but we can't ignore the fact that for the first time since the end of the Second World War, part of the borders of a European territory has been violated by a military attack and that is unacceptable.\"\nSir Malcolm, who was foreign secretary between 1995 and 1997 when Sir John Major was in Downing Street, added: \"If there had to be such a ban I am rather proud to be on it - I'd be rather miffed if I wasn't.\n\"But I've got no immediate plans to go to Russia and haven't had to change my diary, let's put it that way!\"","93":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Welshman crossed the line 15 hours, 59 minutes and 29 seconds after winner Armel le Cleac'h who set a record time of 74 days, three hours and 35 minutes.\nThe 42-year-old Gosport-based Thomson's boat Hugo Boss crossed the line off the coast of France surrounded by a flotilla of smaller craft.\n\"Finishing this race is a result, but second is fantastic,\" he said.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I finished third last time so it's definitely a step up but it wasn't quite the first I was after.\n\"I've probably slept about five hours in the past three days and I haven't slept at all in the last 24 hours so I was running on the final bit of adrenaline left in my body.\n\"I've spent 70-odd days on my own and suddenly there's hundreds of people here and when I go in to the channel there's probably going to be hundreds of thousands.\n\"It's an amazing contrast and it's a wonderful way to finish.\"\nBangor-born Thomson was joined on his boat by his wife Kate and children Oscar and Georgia, and said their support meant he had never felt lonely during his epic journey.\n\"I didn't feel lonely - you can be in a large group of people and feel lonely,\" he said.\n\"I've got a beautiful wife and great kids supporting me - how can I feel lonely?\"\nThomson matches Dame Ellen MacArthur as the best British competitor in the Vendee Globe.

It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed.\nRecently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up.\nThe invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama.\nBut alongside the storytelling, Dr Kostya Trachenko is adamant there are important measurements to be made. He and his undergraduate students at Queen Mary University of London put their pitch into five different funnels, with different sized openings.\nPitch, or bitumen, is the black muck left over from distilling crude oil, and can also be produced by heating wood. It is a liquid at high temperatures but becomes very hard when it cools down, which makes it useful in waterproofing and road surfacing.\nAt normal room temperature, in fact, a lump of pitch can be shattered with a hammer.\n\"We convincingly saw that it behaves like a liquid,\" Dr Trachenko says as he shows me the set-up, clearly proud of his students' work. \"And we were also able to quantify it - because in physics it's important to attach a number to the process.\"\nAs you would predict for a liquid, the bigger openings let more pitch through: almost 53g over the course of a year for the widest (6mm), compared to 5g for the narrowest (2.5mm).\nThis rate is positively heart-stopping by comparison with the best-known experiment of this kind, which began in Brisbane, Australia, in 1927. There, at the University of Queensland, Prof Thomas Parnell let some pitch solidify in the top of a funnel - and waited.\nProf Parnell, a Cambridge graduate and veteran of World War One, wanted to show his students that if you watched it for long enough, it would still flow like a liquid.\nIt was a long wait. The funnel dripped its first drop in 1938 and only eight more have fallen since.\nIn 1961, just three drops later, a new lecturer called John Mainstone adopted the experiment after a colleague pointed it out, gathering dust in a cupboard. He eventually persuaded the university to put it on display and the drops became talking points.\nProf Mainstone, however, never saw the pitch in motion. In 1979, the sixth drop went on a weekend. In 1988, with the experiment proudly displayed at Brisbane's World Expo, Prof Mainstone was fetching a drink when the seventh drop fell. By 2000, a video camera had been set up to capture drop number eight, but it malfunctioned at the crucial moment.\nWhen the ninth drop fell in April this year it was watched by three webcams and thousands of online enthusiasts - but not by Prof Mainstone, who died eight months earlier at the age of 78.\nThe Queensland experiment itself was pipped to the post of posterity in July 2013, when another long-standing funnel of pitch became the first to drip a drop in public. At Trinity College Dublin, a very similar set-up dating from 1944 was filmed as it shed a black blob into its own beaker, offering the first ever glimpse of such an event taking place.\nDr Shane Bergin, a physicist and senior research fellow at Trinity, explains that it was the feeling of suspense in the Brisbane story that rekindled interest in the Dublin drop. \"Eventually, when our one was caught on camera, it provided the world with a kind of scientific 'Aaaah' moment,\" he says. \"As in, finally, we see it!\n\"In a world where we expect to expect things to happen very quickly, and stuff is demanded of us instantaneously, it's a little quirky to think that a lot of stuff just happens on a time scale that's much slower than we can normally appreciate.\"\nAll this drawn-out drama could be accelerated, of course, if the pitch was warmed up. Pitch is one of a group of substances called \"glasses\" which, when cooled, become hard and solid-seeming, despite maintaining the jumbled molecular structure of a liquid. There is no obvious shift to a more rigid, crystalline organisation of molecules, which happens when water and other liquids freeze. Glasses just get steadily slower and stiffer as the temperature drops.\nSo the famous experiments, Dr Trachenko insists, could be made even drearier. \"If you put it in the fridge, it would take thousands of years,\"  he points out, with a dry smile. \"For a theorist like myself, 70 years is actually not that long.\"\nWindow glass belongs in the same category, but debate has raged for years among physicists as to whether solid glass in fact represents a different \"phase\" of matter. Dr Trachenko believes that all of the pitch drop results, including those of his students' project, are important evidence to the contrary.\n\"Even though glass is a familiar system, explaining how it forms is a big deal in modern physics research,\" he says.\n\"Once we assume that the behaviour is essentially liquid-like... we can come up with equations to predict how long it would take for solid glass to flow, even though we would never ever see it.\"\nDr Trachenko is firmly in the camp that sees glass as \"merely a very viscous liquid\" and has published calculations and models in support of that view, based on the way it absorbs heat and behaves under pressure.\nThe popular myth, however, that ancient windows are thicker at the bottom because the glass has sagged with the centuries, is wide of the mark. They have thicker edges because they were made that way, Dr Trachenko is quick to explain.\nTo see glass flow would take an almost unimaginably long time, he says - but it would happen.\n\"If you wait longer than the age of the universe, you'll see this as a liquid.\" Dr Trachenko taps the glass cabinet that houses his students' pitch funnels. \"It would flow. And that would be the end of it.\"\nThat is a long wait to win an argument. In the meantime, he relies on maths.\n\"For physicists, one billion years is not much different from one second. It's just a number. It's an extremely long number, but I can quantify the process.\"\nAnd to go with the numbers, he now has observations from the dribbles of bitumen inside the cabinet.\nTheir comparatively speedy flow, with multiple drips from multiple funnels, allowed Dr Trachenko's students to calculate - and publish - the average \"viscosity\" of their pitch, measured in units called pascal-seconds. (About eight million pascal-seconds, to be precise.)\nBy that measure, they estimate it is thirty times runnier than the pitch used in Queensland, a million times runnier than glass, and a hundred billion times thicker than water.\nRelative runniness can be important. A recently rediscovered pitch drop experiment at Aberystwyth University in Wales actually predates the famous Queensland funnel by 13 years - but its pitch is stiffer and has never yielded a single drop.\nIn fact, it has barely entered the stem of the funnel and is unlikely to bear fruit for at least 1,300 years.\nThe Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow, meanwhile, contains two remarkable demonstrations set up in the 1800s by renowned physicist Lord Kelvin. Intrigued by some of the same questions as Drs Parnell, Mainstone and Trachenko, Kelvin placed bullets on top of a dish of hard, black pitch, and corks at the bottom: over time, the bullets sank and the corks floated.\nLord Kelvin also showed that the flow of pitch is genuinely glacial, with a mahogany ramp that allowed it to slide imperceptibly downward and form similar shapes and patterns to rivers of ice in the Alps.\nThe inexorable intrigue of these experiments exerts an obvious pull on our imagination.\n\"People are genuinely curious,\" says Dr Bergin from Dublin, where the Trinity College pitch drop is slated to be moved into a public exhibition space.  \"We want to use it as a hook to show that physics tries to understand the universe, from the nitty gritty to the super duper, and all of the wacky stuff that's in there as well.\n\"We're going to start a new, bigger pitch drop here in Trinity as well. We figured, why not?\"\nBack in London, Dr Trachenko similarly loves the idea of challenging the intuitions of his students - and the public. \"It reminds people that the physical world is not about us,\" he says. \"We are just passers-by.\"\nBut he also maintains that there are real findings to be made.\nModelling how materials like glass behave in the longest of long terms, Dr Trachenko says, could help plan for the safe disposal of nuclear waste that takes millions of years to decay. \"That's not an experiment you can check in the lab.\"\nHe is clearly not finished with pitch - nor with his students.\n\"There are two jars on my shelf,\" he says with a hint of mischief. \"The second one is more viscous.\"\nAs soon as the fastest flowing funnel in his current set-up is empty, Dr Trachenko is obviously itching to test out the even stickier stuff. He guesses that the next crop of students might need the entire length of their degree to get results.\n\"If they measure the viscosity of that one, then maybe they can hope for an extra grade.\"\nAnd if they learn from history as well as physics, his students will be checking their camera twice.","102":"A number of villages have unsuccessfully campaigned against the opening of pharmacies in recent years.\nThey have claimed local GP surgeries lose income from having their own dispensary if a pharmacy moves into the area.\nThe Scottish government said the new processes would give local communities a stronger voice.\nIt said the changes, which will come into force on 28 June, would improve arrangements for public consultation and community engagement in the wider pharmacy application process, as well as introducing statutory timeframes for health boards to reach decisions.\nNHS boards will also be required to apply new tests when considering pharmacy applications in designated and clearly identified rural or remote areas.\nThey will be given powers to refuse a pharmacy application if they would adversely impact on the security and sustainable provision of existing NHS primary medical and pharmaceutical services in the area concerned.\nHealth Secretary Alex Neil said: \"In recent years there has been understandable concern from communities in rural and remote areas about the impact that the opening of a new pharmacy might have on their local GP services.\n\"That's why I announced an immediate review of the existing arrangements in September last year with a view to amending the legislation.\n\"A key element of that review was to test a number of proposals in our public consultation earlier this year. The responses to that consultation have been independently analysed and showed broad support for our proposals - the amended regulations build on those proposals.\"\nThe Scottish government said proposed changes to the regulations had been supported by both the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Scotland (RPSS) and the Royal College of General Practitioners in Scotland (RCGPS).\nIn her response to the consultation, Aileen Bryson of the RPSS said: \"We fully support the need for dispensing doctors in remote and rural areas, where there is no possibility of providing a full NHS pharmacy service, and are delighted to see an acknowledgement of the requirement for pharmaceutical care to be provided in addition to dispensing.\"\nMiles Mack, of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGPS), said in his response: \"The designation of 'controlled remote and rural and isolated localities' will be a significant step forward in health service planning for these areas.\"","103":"They have been on strike since 24 March in a dispute over cuts to pay and working conditions.\nManagement has said the changes are essential to avert the prospect of insolvency at the loss-making company.\nThe company said services may resume in some cities on Thursday, but the majority will not be operational until Friday morning at the latest.\nThe Labour Court has been considering the issues in the dispute after talks broke down at the Workplace Relations Commission earlier this week.\nA court recommendation issued on Thursday stated that Bus \u00c9ireann told the Labour Court it was currently insolvent.\nLabour Court chairman Kevin Foley describes this assertion as being of the \"gravest significance\" for those who work at the company and said the court had to give such a contention the most serious consideration.\nThe recommendation also acknowledges it must also give the most serious consideration to the effect of the proposed changes on Bus \u00c9ireann employees.\nIt notes there is little point in making a recommendation which would ensure that the company went out of business, or that did not give staff an opportunity to maintain sustainable employment on fair and reasonable terms into the future.\nMr Foley makes a number of recommendations including some pay cuts, voluntary redundancies, work practice reforms and depot closures in a bid to restore the financial viability of Bus \u00c9ireann.\nIn a statement on Thursday, National Bus and Rail Union general secretary, Dermot O'Leary, said: \"Our contention that major cultural change is imminent has been borne out by this recommendation.\n\"We will now move immediately into a consultative phase with our members across Bus \u00c9ireann.\"\nUnion members will then hold a ballot on the recommendation.\nSIPTU sector organiser, Willie Noone, said that the Labour Court recommendation had to be studied by every union member and the consequences of accepting or rejecting it considered.\n\"SIPTU representatives will endeavour to ensure all our members are fully informed prior to balloting on the recommendation,\" he added.","104":"More than 1.3m Londoners voted for him - that's almost 57% of those voting - and he quit as Tooting MP straight away to become in his words a \"full-time mayor\".\nWeeks later events overshadowed his win as the EU referendum result went against the wishes of almost 60% of Londoners and Mr Khan became a cheerleader for an \"open\" London.\nAnd in March, he was faced with the news all London mayors dread, yet expect - a terrorist attack in the capital.\nA year on and Sadiq Khan remains a popular figure in the capital. A YouGov poll commissioned by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University in March found that 58% of those surveyed thought he was doing good job.\nAnd like Ken and Boris before him, Sadiq has become known by his first name alone in what is now something of a tradition for London mayors.\nWhen it comes to leadership style though, his approach has not been nearly as flamboyant as that of his predecessors.\nAccording to Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics (LSE): \"From the beginning [Sadiq] wanted to run City Hall in an understated, cautious, non-flashy way.\n\"Sadiq is much more conventional than previous mayors and operates the City Hall machine like an ex-minister would approach government.\"\nMr Khan is an ex minister; he served as a junior transport minister in Gordon Brown's government.\nOn entering City Hall he presented himself as a mayor who wanted to get things done, particularly in the area of transport where he has already ticked several policy pledges off his list:\nMartin Hoscik of the website MayorWatch believes the Hopper \"scored an early win\".\n\"It is already transforming how many passengers use the bus network and, taken alongside his fares freeze, it is making public transport more affordable after years of fare hikes under Boris Johnson,\" he said.\nThe environment has been another area where the new mayor has focused his energies, with plans already in place to start charging the most polluting cars extra to travel in central London.\nHe has also been a fan of holding reviews into everything, from London's terror readiness and the impact of future financial devolution, to the Garden Bridge project (which has now been all but mothballed).\nMr Khan has also spent much of his first year lobbying government on issues affecting Londoners, from the fate of EU migrants in London post-Brexit, to pushing for control of suburban rail lines and trying to make sure Crossrail 2 gets built.\nThe government has given him no assurances on any of those issues yet, which presents a problem according to Martin Hoscik.\n\"There are times when calls for ministerial and government action risk casting him as a powerless opposition spokesman and not, as he is, an executive office holder with great power of his own,\" Mr Hoscik said.\nHousing is an issue the mayor of London does have responsibility over - more so now that the government has given him the task of building of 90,000 new affordable homes by 2021.\nHe has made some headway with his Homes for Londoners team and last week - just in time for his anniversary in power - he delivered the first 76 of his long promised London Living Rent homes, designed to help middle income renters save for a deposit.\nProf Travers said that under Mr Khan there had been \"a change in emphasis towards affordability, but the impact can only be judged a year from now\".\nSo it is too early to say how the new mayor of London has done on housing, but this is one nut he will need to crack if he wants his mayoralty to be viewed as a success.","105":"They are looking to open up investment opportunities for UK firms in India's defence and infrastructure sector, and attract Indian investment into Britain.\nThe visit comes as a new government led by Narendra Modi has taken charge in India - Asia's third-largest economy.\nMr Modi is widely expected to announce new reforms to boost economic growth.\n\"I believe a stronger relationship with Britain will help deliver the new economic policy of the Indian government,\" Mr Osborne said in a speech in Mumbai.\n\"Prime Minister Modi is seeking more investment in India's economy - and I want British companies to provide it, and the British government to support it.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Osborne also announced that Indian pharmaceutical company Cipla is to invest up to \u00c2\u00a3100m in the UK.\nIndia's economy has struggled in recent years with rising price pressures and problems with bureaucracy and corruption.\nThat has hurt the confidence of foreign investors looking to enter the country.\nHowever, a landslide win for the Mr Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recent general elections has sparked hopes of a revival in India's economy.\nBoth foreign and local investors have been hoping that Mr Modi will introduce fresh reforms and boost investment in key sectors to help spur growth.\nBy Robert PestonEconomics editor\nAs a result, various countries have been keen to boost ties with India's new government and open up opportunities for their businesses.\n\"It's great to be here at a time when the excitement about the Indian economy, and the optimism about the prospects for future growth, are palpable,\" Mr Osborne said.\n\"And the excitement here is matched by new confidence among international investors abroad in the future of the Indian economy.\n\"It is a measure of the ambition and drive and pace of the new government of prime minister Modi, that this complete turn-around in sentiment about the Indian economy has been achieved in just seven short weeks, since that stunning election victory.\"\nThe visit by Britain's two senior ministers follows a series of other high-profile visits to India - including those by the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi.","106":"The finance committee is investigating the \u00a31bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan book.\nEarlier this month, businessman Gareth Graham accused Frank Cushnahan of trying to ruin his family's business.\nBut Mr Cushnahan has now issued a lengthy rebuttal of Mr Graham's claims.\nIn a letter sent on his behalf by a solicitor, he states that he \"achieved a maximisation of value\" for the SP Graham Group that he advised for three years.\nMr Cushnahan's letter also deals with tapes made of his phone calls and allegations that he had a conflict of interest.\nMr Graham told the committee's inquiry that Mr Cushnahan was conflicted in his Nama role because he retained shareholdings in some Graham property companies that were moved into Nama, effectively a \"bad bank\" responsible for recovering the value of problematic loans made by other Irish banks.\nBut Mr Cushnahan said he gave up those shareholdings in 2009 and that if he remains on the share register it is only because the Graham companies have not provided the necessary updates.\nMr Graham said recordings of Mr Cushnahan's phone calls could expose an \"ingrained culture of inappropriate and possibly illegal conduct\" across political, banking, legal and accountancy sectors.\nPhone calls in and out of the Grahams' bookmaking business were recorded for regulatory reasons.\nMr Cushnahan said that he was never informed his calls were being recorded and he believes it was illegal to do so.\nHe added that they deal with \"all aspects\" of his professional and personal life, and that Mr Graham had no right to listen to them or disclose their content.\nThe recordings were made between 2005 and 2008.\nIt is understood Mr Graham stands fully behind the evidence he gave and will point to a staff handbook that referred to the fact that all calls were recorded.\nMr Cushnahan sat on Nama's Northern Ireland advisory committee from 2010 until 2013.\nHe then worked as an adviser to US investment firm Pimco, one of the companies that wanted to buy Nama's Northern Ireland loans.\nHe was in line for a \u00a35m payment if Pimco's bid was successful, an Irish parliament committee was told.\nBut Pimco pulled out after discovering the fee arrangement.\nWeeks after Pimco withdrew due to its concerns, Nama's loan portfolio sale went ahead to a different bidder, US investment firm Cerberus.\nIn his letter Mr Cushnahan states that he never had \"any meetings, dealings, correspondence or contact\" with Cerberus or any of its representatives.\nThe letter also criticises the conduct of the committee and expresses concern that the loyalist campaigner Jamie Bryson may be asked to give evidence in public.","107":"Robert Fidler, from Salfords, in Surrey, has managed to prevent the destruction of his house since it was revealed in 2006.\nHe has received a three-month suspended sentence and has been ordered to knock it down by 6 June 2016.\nBBC News looks back at how the story has developed.\nIn secret and hidden behind hay bales, Mr Fidler built his new home some time between 1999 and 2006.\nIt was not spotted when planning officers visited the farm on a separate issue in 2002, inadvertently taking a picture of the hay bales (above), but not noticing the \"castle\".\nThe hay bales were removed and Mr Fidler presented his castle - complete with ramparts - to the world.\nBuilt in secret and with no planning permission, he claimed it was immune from enforcement action due to the \"four-year rule\".\nThis is a planning law which allows a building to become lawful if it has been complete for four years.\nFearing it had no choice, Reigate and Banstead Borough Council served an enforcement notice requiring the house to be demolished.\nThe authority said the home was built on the metropolitan green belt and was contrary to national and regional planning policies.\nMr Fidler claimed he started building the structure when the council did not answer his planning application within two months.\nMr Fidler took his case to the Planning Inspectorate and appealed against the decision.\nHe said: \"There are two ways of getting planning permission, you either apply for it, which I did and they refused to process my planning application, so I took the alternative.\n\"If I build the house and they don't see it for four years then it becomes legal and that's the way I went about it.\"\nHowever, the inspector dismissed his case saying the removal of the hay bales was an integral part of the building operations, therefore the house was not finished until the bales were removed.\nIn the meantime, Mr Fidler built a go-kart track, a lake, bridge and a \"marquee structure\" - all without planning permission.\nA series of court battles followed, with Mr Fidler first taking his case to the High Court.\nThe judge dismissed his case, backing the council's decision.\nHe then went to the Court of Appeal. Again the council's decision was supported, while Mr Fidler's actions were described as a \"paradigm of deception\".\nEvents slowed as Mr Fiddler submitted several different planning applications to the council.\nIn June 2014 the council obtained a High Court injunction requiring Mr Fidler to comply with four outstanding enforcement notices.\nThe court gives Mr Fidler 90 days to demolish the castle.\nIn August the council lodged an application for a contempt of court hearing to take place after Mr Fidler failed to knock his home down.\nThe hearing date was set for 22 October, however, Mr Fidler failed to appear at court. The judge issued a warrant for his arrest and the hearing was rescheduled for 2 November.\nMr Fidler then arrived at court, claiming he missed the case believing it to be held later that day.\nThe hearing was rescheduled and on 9 November Mr Fidler was found in contempt of court.\nHe was given a three-month suspended sentence and ordered to knock his home down by 6 June 2016.","108":"The Scot, 40, has won the ranking tournament three times in the last six years, and four times in all.\n\"It doesn't really matter,\" the defending champion told BBC Radio Scotland. \"There are probably other players that are more favoured than me.\n\"It would be great if I could win it for a fifth time but we will just have to wait and see.\"\nFour-time world champion Higgins opens the defence of his title against Andy Hicks, 42, a former World and UK Championship semi-finalist, on Monday.\n\"He used to be a really good player,\" Higgins noted. \"He is is not a professional anymore, he just plays for fun now.  But he won't have any expectations on him to win, he can just enjoy himself, so it is a tough game for me.\"\nHiggins is one of 12 Scots in the 128-man first-round draw and is monitoring the progress of youngsters like Ross Muir, 20, Rhys Clark and Scott Donaldson, both 21, and Eden Sharav, 23.\n\"Young Rhys Clark just beat [1997 world champion] Ken Doherty in the China Open qualifiers,\" Higgins noted. \" I was playing on the next table and was 3-1 up thinking I was going quite well, and he'd already won 5-0.\n\"He's left-handed and plays just like Jimmy White, really quickly.  It is brilliant to see some of these young Scottish players coming through.\"\nWhile the younger generation strive to make progress, Higgins - who has won two more ranking titles this season in Australia and China to take his haul to 28 - has no plans to retire.\n\"I have got nothing else to do!\" he joked.  \"I am going to keep playing as long as I can.\n\"The practice gets harder as you get older.  I saw how the likes of Steve Davis, John Parrott and Jimmy White found it tougher to practise once they had families.  I am the same, with three kids.\n\"There is a lot more travelling nowadays, but I still love competing against the best players around the world.\"\nFull Welsh Open draw","109":"Budgets for investment, known as capital, have been raided in recent years by the Department of Health to help hospitals and other trusts in England cover their running costs. NHS leaders are now pushing for investment to allow them to repair decaying buildings, upgrade facilities and fund new plans to develop care in local communities.  If central government funding is limited, they argue, the alternative is private finance.\nJim Mackey who heads the financial regulator NHS Improvement, along with other health service officials, has had discussions with private financial institutions. My understanding is that they are at the conservative end of the spectrum, for example pension funds, rather than the racier speculators seen in dramas like \"Billions\".\nPension funds and other long term investors are always looking for secure long term havens with a regular stream of income. They are already pursuing public sector infrastructure schemes and have now expressed a willingness to lend money for health service building projects.\nMr Mackey recently told Health Service Journal: \"An NHS Fund could power the improvement needed to sort out problems at our hospitals and to drive the change required to get the NHS ready for future challenges. If we are open to new ideas then we could really be in business.\"\nA leading former hospital chief executive Sir Robert Naylor recently produced a report for the Department of Health which argued that without investment  \"the NHS estate will remain unfit for purpose and will continue to deteriorate\". Sir Robert said that \u00a310 billion was required both for backlog maintenance work and transforming services, \u00a35 billion of which might be raised by selling off unwanted properties. That leaves a \u00a35 billion gap to come from somewhere.\nIt all sounds straightforward but these things often do. The Treasury has to be convinced that the sums add up and to that end are in talks with Mr Mackey and his NHS colleagues. Officials are haunted by the memory of the original PFI which delivered sparkling new hospitals but with numerous strings attached. Taxpayers came out badly from the original PFI deals and the costs will mount up for hospitals over decades.\nSome will argue that the obvious answer to NHS funding challenges is higher public borrowing. The interest rates which HM Government pays on its debt are at or close to historic low levels. If the Treasury can borrow cheaply to invest in hospitals, why involve the private sector which will need to build a profit margin into any deal with the NHS?\nWhitehall sources indicate that Mr Mackey's talks are at an early stage and nothing has been approved. They point out that the Chancellor Philip Hammond did announce new capital investment for the NHS in the Budget and has promised more in the Autumn Statement. But at a time when he is trying to keep deficit reduction on track, borrowing a lot more for the NHS may have limited appeal for Mr Hammond.\nThe \u00a35 billion investment challenge for England's hospitals is out there. NHS leaders know that it needs to be addressed and that the private sector could help. The question now is whether ministers and Treasury mandarins can trust them to do the right deals and, if not, where the money might come from.","110":"In an April speech at Columbia University in New York City, Mrs Clinton spoke about issues with the US justice system. She said it is time to end the era of mass incarceration.\n\"My heart breaks for these young men and their families\", said Mrs Clinton, referring to black men killed in officer-involved shootings across the US since last year. The US needs \"a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.\"\nMrs Clinton has called for campaign finance repeatedly on the campaign trail, despite controversy over money sourcing in her own Clinton Foundation and her immense fundraising.\n\"We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccounted money out of it, once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment,\" said Mrs Clinton at a speech in Iowa in April.\nMrs Clinton has aligned herself with campaigns for higher minimum wage in the US.\n\"Fight for $15\", a US group pushing for higher minimum wage, got a big boost when Mrs Clinton expressed her support, calling in during one of its events this month.\n\"No man or woman who works hard to feed America's families should have to be on food stamps to feed your own families\", she said. \"It is wrong that so many people stand against you thinking that they can steal your wages with no consequences.\"\nDrop by drop, piece by piece, the policy proposals that will form the backbone of Hillary Clinton's campaign are coming to light.\nSpeculation that the former secretary of state would play to the political middle thanks to her lack of significant competition in the  Democratic primaries seems to have been unfounded.\nAlthough there's still a lot of fleshing out to do, her political manifesto so far - on topics like immigration, sentencing reform and higher education - offers plenty of red meat to her party's progressive base.\nThe labelling of Mrs Clinton as a political centrist in the mould of her husband, Bill Clinton, has always been a bit off.\nWhile her sometimes assertive foreign policy positions and close relationship with deep-pocketed Wall Street supporters may give that impression, she has a long track record of outspoken liberal advocacy on issues like children's and women's rights, healthcare and social welfare.\nThe challenge for Mrs Clinton will be highlighting these views to motivate a Democratic base that turned out in record numbers for Barack Obama while framing them in way that remains appealing to whatever swing voters still remain in the sharply polarised US electorate.\nMrs Clinton said in May she wants to pass comprehensive immigration reform \"once and for all\". Fixing the immigration system is both a family and economic issue, she said.\n\"[Comprehensive immigration reform] will strengthen families, strengthen our economy and strengthen our country. That's why we can't wait any longer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for a path to full and equal citizenship.\"\nIf Congress refuses to act, Mrs Clinton said she would do everything possible under the law to fight for people at risk of deportation from the US.\nIn Iowa during her first official campaign stop, Mrs Clinton said community college should be free, agreeing with President Barack Obama's plan.\nShe has expressed her opposition to for-profit colleges that \"fraud\" students and agrees with loan forgiveness in those cases.\nMrs Clinton has also been working on student loan reform, which she is expected to talk about at her campaign event on Saturday in New York City.\nThis month, Mrs Clinton called for expanding voting rights in America and lambasted what she called Republican efforts to restrict them.  She said she wants universal, automatic voter registration for every American when they turn 18.\nMrs Clinton has also urged for Congress to restore key sections of the Voting Rights Act, a US law the Supreme Court partially invalidated.\n\"We should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less,\" said Mrs Clinton.\nIn May, Mrs Clinton's advisers had talks with substance abuse experts in Iowa and New Hampshire, showing her desire to create unspecific solutions to a growing drug epidemic in the US.\n\"I am convinced that the mental health issue - because I consider substance abuse part of mental health issues - is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it's a big issue people raise with me,\" Mrs Clinton said at an April event in New Hampshire.\nShe said there is a \"hidden epidemic\" of drug use striking small towns.","111":"The visitors went ahead when the Rams failed to deal with Marc Roberts' long throw and on-loan midfielder Matty James headed home.\nThe lead lasted only two minutes as Tom Ince fired into the net after Barnsley's defence failed to clear.\nInce then hit the post before David Nugent struck with the help of a deflection - his first goal for Derby.\nThe three points lifted Steve McClaren's Rams, who had lost three of the previous four games, above their opponents into 10th place in the Championship table - but 10 points adrift of Sheffield Wednesday in sixth.\nIt took the hosts half an hour to muster a shot on goal as Paul Heckingbottom's Tykes made a lively start with striker Adam Armstrong, in particular, threatening an early breakthrough.\nThe home team put their sluggish opening behind them as Johnny Russell and Julien de Sart tested goalkeeper Adam Davies, but they paid the price for poor marking when James nodded into the corner after the break. It was his first goal since scoring for parent club Leicester in a 2-2 draw with Watford more than three years ago.\nInce pounced for the equaliser as Barnsley's defence failed to deal with a ball into the box, but although Davies tipped over from Russell's curler, he could do nothing with Nugent's effort which wrongfooted him after hitting defender Angus MacDonald.\nDerby boss Steve McClaren: \"It's a big win for us and I have to say it was fantastic character from 1-0 down from a long throw and everyone could have gone down.\n\"It was important to react quickly which we did and then it was quite an open game, but we got the goal and then hung on at the end.\n\"It's one game at a time, I hate losing and I've been angry in the last couple of weeks. It's not a pleasant taste and we talked about finding a way to win today.\n\"Two defeats put us back in terms of confidence and we're now just trying to build confidence.\"\nBarnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:  \"The players are an honest bunch and they are disappointed with the two goals we have conceded.\n\"I'm disappointed with a few performances in that we weren't positive enough and didn't have a big enough effect on the game to make us win it.\n\"If you think you are conceding sloppy goals and some of your players aren't at their best, the fact we've lost 2-1 and could have got something out of the game shows how far we've come.\n\"I'm generally not bad at getting the result in perspective, good or bad, but I feel a bit thrown today from the feedback I'm getting from other people and how I feel about the game.\"\nMatch ends, Derby County 2, Barnsley 1.\nSecond Half ends, Derby County 2, Barnsley 1.\nJacob Butterfield (Derby County) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nFoul by Ryan Kent (Barnsley).\nAttempt saved.

It eventually complied later when they made a second attempt.\nFaraday plans to release the FF91 in 2018. To pre-order, hopefuls will need to provide a refundable $5,000 (\u00c2\u00a34,080) deposit.\nThe event came a year after the firm's first press conference, where it showed off a futuristic-looking concept vehicle. Several commentators criticised it at the time for failing to give more detail about what it was actually working on.\nProspective buyers were told they would be able to connect to the forthcoming car via a virtual \"FFID\" account.\nWith this, Mr Sampson explained, it would be possible to share data - such as movies or route plans - to the car from personal computers, for example.\nTech launches are famed for their awkward exchanges on stage, but the dynamic between Faraday Future's Nick Sampson and LeEco boss Jia Yueting was on another level.\nSampson is the company's figurehead at events like this, glitzy launches where big promises are made. Mr Jia holds the financial keys to keep the Faraday Future project going - the money from his China-based firm is bankrolling the efforts here (at least, we think it is - neither firm will discuss the nature of the deal).\nSo when the newly-launched car failed to drive itself a few feet in front of the audience, Sampson was almost apologetic to Mr Jia. For the audience, it suddenly felt like we'd stumbled into a product pitch meeting and were watching Sampson pick up the pieces.\nIn the unscientific poll I conducted shortly after the presentation, all felt the design of the FF91 fell short of Tesla's vehicles in the style-stakes. As I type this, Elon Musk is yet to offer any reaction to his newest competitor. I don't think he'll be losing any sleep. Experience has shown him that making the car is the easy bit - producing it on en masse is far more difficult.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nFaraday Future has lately been in the news for less celebratory reasons - its troubled finances.\nIn November, it confirmed that work had stopped on a huge factory in Las Vegas intended to manufacture a car backed by investment from LeEco.\nA week earlier, the Bloomberg news agency had revealed that Mr Jia had written to LeEco's employees to say his firm's finances were under pressure.\nEver since it unveiled a futuristic concept car at last year's CES, Faraday Future has been met with much scepticism, said Gartner automotive analyst Mike Ramsay.\n\"This is a must impress situation,\" he added.\n\"Even if everything had been going perfectly, it is very difficult to be a start-up carmaker, particularly when you are coming from a tech background.\"\nHaving seen the presentation, Mr Ramsay commented that he was \"not convinced\" that the firm was yet a clear contender.\n\"It still seems like it's more in the realm of fantasy than reality,\" he added.\n\"For the car to have a 130 kWh battery pack, it would be very heavy, and very expensive - extremely expensive to have a battery that size.\"\nOn stage, Faraday executive Peter Savagian explained that the FF19 would be chargeable from various electrical standards.\nHe added its range would extend to 482 miles (775km) when driven at 55mph.\nMany analysts expect interest in electric vehicles to continue to rise in coming years.\n\"We estimate around one in 10 vehicles will be electric or hybrid by 2020, at around 8 million vehicles,\" said Simon Bryant at analysts Futuresource.\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk\/ces2017\nBut companies like Faraday Future face competition from more established rivals -

They face a maximum fine of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3734; $1,134) if they fail to pass the test by a certain deadline.\nThe applicant has to pay a \u20ac230 fee each time he or she sits the Dutch test.\nThe court ruling criticised that fee and the \"relatively high\" fine that can be imposed but it is up to the Dutch courts to decide whether to change the cost.","120":"Leading economist Lord Nicholas Stern said that a commitment to sustainable development was more important than a binding deal that \"lacked credibility\".\nHe was speaking in Lima, Peru, where negotiators from 194 countries are heading into a second week of UN talks.\nThey hope to agree a text that would form the basis of new global compact, to be signed in Paris next year.\nMany developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997.\nOne key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon.\nAccording to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format.\n\"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said.\n\"That, in my view, is a serious mistake. The sanctions available under the Kyoto Protocol, for example, were notionally legally-binding but were simply not credible and failed to guarantee domestic implementation of commitments.\"\nIn Lima, negotiators are trying to hammer out the format that mitigation efforts should take. By the end of March next year countries have to declare their hands, but they have yet to formalize what will be included in these commitments and what will not.\nLord Stern believes that grounding the process in the laws and promises that countries undertake by themselves is a better model for a deal than a top-down process like Kyoto.\n\"It will be enforceable and deliverable through the arrangements and laws in the countries themselves.\n\"That way you will get stronger ambition as countries won't be tempted to be hesitant about some type of international sanction.\"\nWhile the European Union has stated that it is committed to legally binding mitigation targets, other countries have sought different formats.\nAccording to US special envoy on climate change, Todd Stern, the US is unhappy with the prospect of a legally binding deal, knowing that getting it ratified in the Senate would be an uphill battle.\n\"Proposals that would involve, in effect, a kind of designated burden-sharing on how reductions should be split up among countries of the world has extremely little chance of political viability,\" he said, speaking to reporters last month.\n\"Countries are not going to buy into that.\"\nOver the next week here in Lima, negotiators will try to make progress on the format of a deal. For observers such as Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid, any agreement must has some legal teeth.\n\"The UN multilateral system works best with clear rules,\" he told BBC News.\n\"To ensure that the pledges included in the Paris deal are implemented on the ground, countries need to trust each other. Having at least some legally binding rules to the Paris agreement is the best way to make sure countries will hold each other accountable.\"\nRegardless of whether the deal ultimately is legally binding or not, Lord Stern believes that a focus on equity and sustainable development is the most important element, and one that would win strong support from developing countries.\n\"It means that the richer people have the bigger responsibilities but I think that speaking strongly about development and reducing poverty is a much better way to search for an equitable agreement.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter: @mattmcgrathbbc.","121":"Kim, who led by two overnight, carded six birdies to move onto 17 under par, clear of England's Georgia Hall (70) and Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn (67).\nCompatriot Inbee Park matched Michelle Wie's first-round course record 64 to move into a share of fourth.\nAmerican Ally McDonald (70) is also seven shots back on 10 under.\nPark, the 29-year-old Olympic champion bidding for a second British Open title after her 2015 triumph, birdied her opening two holes, picked up three more shots before the turn and then birdied the 11th, 13th and 17th on her back nine, narrowly missing another long birdie putt on the 18th.\n\"I've prepared myself pretty well last week at the Scottish Open, in the bad weather and the bad wind and all sorts,\" she said.\n\"The expectation was pretty low, I just made the cut and I wasn't putting well.\n\"The greens were much quicker today than the last two days which helped me a lot.\"\nThe 2013 winner, Stacy Lewis, also took advantage of the relatively kind conditions to post a seven-under 65 and move up to nine under, eight shots behind.\nBut it is Kim who will head into the final round on Sunday enjoying a commanding lead.\n\"I know the expectation and I haven't made the bogeys yet,\" she said.\n\"But I think I should give myself a little bit of credit for it, and enjoy tonight.

Because of militant attacks, the PPP has been all but unable to campaign for the general elections due on 11 May.\nAmong the many opponents ranged against him are some of the country's most popular politicians, including former PM Nawaz Sharif and more recently former cricketer and Movement for Justice party leader Imran Khan.\nBoth have been critical of President Zardari's support for the US and Nato in the battle against Taliban militants in Afghanistan.\nYet in spite of the wide array of problems he faces, President Zardari has remained doggedly in position - outlasting Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani who in 2012 was forced out of office after the Supreme Court convicted him of contempt for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president.\nMr Zardari's mercurial career has taken many a dramatic turn since his marriage in December 1987 to the charismatic former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\nHe was thrust into the centre of politics when Ms Bhutto was assassinated 20 years later.\nSince then and now his career has veered from being imprisoned for corruption - complaining that he was tortured when behind bars - to taking the country's top job by leading the PPP to victory in general elections after his wife's death.\nPerhaps the high point of his political life came in 2008 when he played a pivotal role with former political enemies to force President Pervez Musharraf to resign.\nBut he has also been the subject of unfavourable scrutiny - in 2010 he was widely criticised for visiting Europe at the height of some of the worst floods to hit Pakistan in recent years.\nIn November 2011 he was dealt another blow by the resignation of Pakistan's ambassador to the US, Husain Haqqani.\nBoth Mr Haqqani and the president were accused of drafting a controversial memo in which they  allegedly sought US military help against a possible military coup in Pakistan. They denied the charges.\nBut his political struggles today are still a far cry from the period before Ms Bhutto's death, when Mr Zardari's public image was so bad that the PPP kept him out of the public eye as much as possible during the campaigning for national elections in February 2008.\nMr Zardari was seen then as a political liability.\nHe spent several years in jail on charges of corruption. He was labelled \"Mr 10%\" for all the kick-backs he is alleged to have received.\nHe found himself in major trouble in 1990 when he was accused, among other things, of tying a remote-controlled bomb to the leg of a businessman and sending him into a bank to withdraw money from his account as a pay-off.\nThose charges were never proved. The PPP had then accused the country's powerful intelligence apparatus of maligning Mr Zardari to damage Ms Bhutto's image.\nIn 1993, when then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan sacked the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Mr Zardari was escorted from the prison straight to the presidency where he was sworn in as a minister in the interim government.\nLater, when the PPP won the 1993 elections, Mr Zardari moved with his wife to the Prime Minister's House in Islamabad where he lived for the next three years.\nIn 1996, when another president sacked the PPP government, he was arrested and charged with a number of offences including the murder of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, his wife's brother.\nHe was later charged, along with his wife, and convicted in a kickbacks scam involving a Swiss company, SGS.\nBut a mistrial was declared by Pakistan's Supreme Court following a major scandal involving the accountability bureau and the judge who had issued the verdict.\nHis last prison sentence lasted eight years until 2004, during which time he says he was tortured.\nIt ended as the then General Musharraf was engaged in protracted negotiations with Benazir Bhutto, then in self-imposed exile, for some form of political reconciliation.\nMr Zardari resolutely stood by his party as well as his wife - although at times he disagreed with the politics of both.\nHis friends say this was entirely in character and that no-one can deny his personal courage.\nA close friend recounts an incident in the 1980s when as a horse-riding bachelor he personally rescued the daughter of a German diplomat who had fallen into a bog with her horse.\nAsif Ali Zardari was born in Karachi to Hakim Ali Zardari, head of one of the \"lesser\" Sindhi tribes, who chose the urban life over rustic surroundings.\nHe grew up in Karachi and was educated at St Patrick's School - also the alma mater of Pervez Musharraf.\nThe young Zardari's main claim to fame was that he had a private disco at home, helping him gain the reputation as a \"playboy\".\nAfter his release from prison in 2004, Mr Zardari kept a low profile, undergoing medical treatment in the US.\nIn addition to his heart problems he is reported to suffer from diabetes and a spinal ailment - which sometimes prevent him from easily moving around.\nMs Bhutto appreciated her husband's loyalty, saying that \"despite his failings, he always stood by his family no matter what\".","123":"The research reported lower sales and turnover, with poorer profit growth.\nThose taking part in the study expected turnover to increase by only 1% in the next 12 months.\nThe business monitor is conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and Grant Thornton UK.\nIt found year-on-year profit growth has fallen from 6% in the second quarter of 2014, to 3.3% in the latest figures.\nThere has been a similar trend in sales volumes and turnover, with export growth being especially hard hit.\nICAEW Scotland President Andrew Hewett said: \"It is disappointing to once again see a drop in confidence amongst Scottish businesses, particularly when it takes us into negative territory.\n\"This is part of an ongoing decline in confidence in Scotland, which can perhaps be attributed to ongoing uncertainty.\n\"The aftermath of the referendum, the run up to the general election, the forthcoming Holyrood elections and the possibility of an EU referendum combine to mean that there is, potentially, an even deeper degree of uncertainty in Scotland than there is elsewhere in the UK, a feeling which is reflected in Scottish confidence levels.\"\nThe research found companies were scaling back on recruitment plans.\nThe number of employees was reported to have increased by 0.7% over the past 12 months. The UK figure for the same period was 2.2%.\nCompanies in Scotland expected their workforce headcount to increase by just 0.3% over the next year.\nThe monitor pointed out that, with Scotland's greater dependence on the public sector, UK government plans to cut spending will combine with a slowing of private sector job creation to \"impact dramatically\" on the Scottish labour market.\nGrant Thornton UK managing partner in Scotland Kevin Engel said: \"This significant drop in confidence north of the border is naturally concerning, particularly given Scotland is the only part of the UK showing such a marked negative trend.\n\"The quarter examined covers the pre-election period, which could go some way to explain the downward shift in confidence.\n\"However the Scottish business community is historically resilient.

Quite early on boys are in wheelchairs before they reach their teenage years.\n\"It then starts to affect the rest of their muscles and that particularly includes their respiratory muscles, their heart, the major muscles of the body and that all needs lots of attention, lots of specialist care to look at.\"\nMr Burke said a specialist centre in Wales would give Seth access to all the help he needed, all under one roof.\n\"You get to see respiratory physicians, cardiac physicians,\" he said. \"You get to see experts in neuro-muscular conditions.\"\nMr Burke said Wales should follow the Danish model of treatement, where men were living into their 30s and 40s as opposed to the average life expectancy of 19 to 21 in the UK.\nIn May, Welsh health minister Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh government was working to improve services and support for individuals and their families who are living with muscular dystrophy.\nMs Griffiths said she was committed to ensuring that all patients with conditions such as muscular dystrophy had personal care plans.\nShe added that clinical staff had said further investment should be used for specialist occupational therapists and psychology staff.","125":"More than 40 history pupils from Slemish College had been planning the trip for over a year.\nHowever, when they arrived at the airport at 05:00 BST on Sunday morning, they found their flight was cancelled.\nEasyjet said the cancellation was because of air traffic control restrictions and weather conditions.\nHistory teacher Paula McHugh said Easyjet did offer alternative arrangements, but none were suitable.\n\"The only option they could come up with was to fly part of the group to Malaga, then to Madrid, then to Krakow which would be a 16-hour journey.\n\"They couldn't accommodate the whole group so this just wasn't an option,\" she said.\nThe group, who have been studying the Holocaust, were supposed to be meeting a survivor as well as visiting the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp during their tour of Poland, which was due to end on Wednesday.\nSlemish College pupil Julia Millar, 15, was one of those who missed out.\nShe said: \"I feel devastated and we don't really know what to do. We could have been in Poland but instead we're in Ballymena.\n\"We were told about this trip at the start of the year and we couldn't wait, we were really excited about it.\n\"Some people have already given away their uniforms to charity because they thought, that because we were going away, school would be over when we got back.\"\nCurtis McIlhagga, also 15, was disappointed too.\n\"Meeting someone like a Holocaust survivor, like we were meant to today, would have really brought history alive for us.\"\n\"Friends of mine have been to Auschwitz and they say while it's not good to see, it's something that's very informative and we know, our generation, that we can't go back to something like that.\"\nIn a statement to the BBC, Easyjet said the flights had been cancelled due to air traffic control restrictions and weather conditions across Europe over the weekend.\nThe airline said: \"The crew for this flight had been delayed on previous flights and could not operate this flight as it would exceed their legal operating hours.\n\"We did everything possible and explored all options to find alternative flights for all passengers. We would like to sincerely apologise that no other flights were available until this coming Tuesday and the group will not be able to travel.\n\"All passengers who did not travel are entitled to a full fare refund and an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 per passenger in compensation.\"","126":"Special Report: The Technology of Business\nConnecting India's offline millions\nThe world's fastest ambulance\nWhen does an app need regulating?\n'Air' plastic and mushroom cushions\nHealth tech start-ups go the long way\nThen a friend suggested a handheld anti-anxiety device.\"I was keen to give it a try, but was not convinced it would be of benefit to me,\" she says.\nThe biosensor device, called Pip, is gripped between the thumb and forefinger, looks a bit like a small iPod, and measures sweat and electrodermal activity associated with stress levels.\nPeople working to manage their anxiety can then play a number of games like Relax & Race, where relaxing confers a competitive advantage.\n\"After a couple of days,\" says Miss Philips, \"I had stopped taking relaxing medication, which I had been relying on due to anxiety.\n\"This was a surprise to me. It was a great tool for helping to slow down your body and mind, a great substitution for relaxing medicine.\"\nPip is among a batch of new stress-management gadgets. It is produced by a Dublin start-up called Galvanic, with Trinity College Dublin psychology professor Ian Robertson as chair of its scientific advisory board.\nThe device, which connects by Bluetooth with smart devices, was originally researched and patented in 2007, but the company did not survive Ireland's downturn.\nSome 10.4 million days are lost annually to work-related stress in the UK, according to the Health and Safety Executive.\nThe World Health Organization says it costs businesses in the US $300bn (\u00c2\u00a3187bn; \u00e2\u201a\u00ac237bn) a year.\nMindfulness - meditation practices found to have an impact on anxiety, by focusing on the present moment - is newly in vogue, with an all-party parliamentary group last month recommending all new NHS medical and teaching staff be given training in it.\nA higher-tech take on mindfulness, Pip is designed for users to pick up and make an effort at managing their stress, through instant biofeedback to learn what techniques work best, says Galvanic's chief executive David Ingram.\nAnother approach is wearable technology - such as Insight, part of the redLoop project and designed at Middlesex University.\nProject director Dr Andy Bardill says, \"[Anxiety has] various different parameters to it, some of which are measurable and can be indicated by reliable biomarkers, while others are more qualitative, more patient dependent.\"\nSkin conductivity - tied to how much you sweat - is a biomarker of stress, part of the fight-or-flight response, but also goes down when there is high humidity, or up when you go up stairs.\n\"Getting baseline data is important: it could be it's gone down because you've done exercise or you're unwell, not because you're anxious,' says Dr Bardill.\nInsight features wristbands, heartbeat monitors, and an iPhone app. With a log of when and where every heartbeat of a person takes place, Dr Bardill says analysing the data requires \"episodic analysis, essentially data analytics used in the intelligence community\".\nAnother wearable device, designed in Canada, is a headband called Muse.\n\"It's clinical grade EEG (electroencephalography, recording brain electrical activity) in this slim, sleek little consumer form factor,\" says Ariel Garten, a psychotherapist and chief executive of InteraXon, which developed the device.\nWith it, a person can track their brain activity in real time on a smartphone or tablet, and practise focused attention.\n\"It's like mindfulness on hyperdrive,\" she says.\nStress tech has been bolstered by the ready availability of smart devices, to which devices like Pip, Insight and Muse can connect by Bluetooth.\nA different approach invokes another recent trend, social networking.\nJennifer Hyatt founded Big White Wall, an anonymous social network to support people in managing mental health. Half its members use the site to relieve anxiety.\nShe began the website after the suicide of a friend's partner, believing technology offered support and recovery tools, carrying no shame or stigma.\nAt the top tier, the website provides a secure Skype-like platform, where a member can deal with an issue directly with a clinician.\nIn middle levels, there is a course on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for managing anxiety. At lower levels, members may write on \"bricks\", set up groups, anonymously befriend others, and track themselves against measures such as GAD 7, a self-administered Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment.\nMs Hyatt says Big White Wall has 4,500 active users in any month. Initially, 40% were under 25; now, the largest group is 35 to 44-year-olds, with over 55s increasing fast.\nSyed Abrar is the man behind Buddy, a mobile phone-based platform.\n\"It can be a \u00c2\u00a310 supermarket throwaway - as long as it sends texts, you can use Buddy,\" he says.\nTexting is discreet, says Mr Abrar. People may not have pens to hand and might need to explain keeping a physical diary, but texting \"allows soldiers to keep their game face on, or you can be sat in a pub, or with parents, and can send stuff and capture feelings in a contemporaneous way\".\nUsers receive texts from Buddy asking how they feel and what they are doing, and later can see links between what they were doing and how they felt - and \"manage their own journey of recovery\".\nOne challenge in evaluating new stress tech devices is the different speed of private technology development versus publicly funded research.\nDr Lisa Marzano, senior psychology lecturer at Middlesex University, says, \"Academia, funding bodies, and research councils work at a very different, much slower pace than the field of computing.\"\nAccordingly, researchers still know relatively little about the effectiveness of new stress tech, or users' experiences in everyday life, or integrating into existing mental health interventions.\n\"When you have something that's evolving so quickly, it's really hard to measure its impact before it evolves yet again,\" adds Sarah Amani from the Oxford Academic Health Science Network.\nA related challenge is identifying good developers.\nThere is a conference next month on frameworks to evaluate mental health apps, shy of large clinical trials, hosted by MindTech, a technology co-operative founded by the Nottinghamshire NHS Trust and University of Nottingham.\nDr Jen Martin, MindTech project manager, counts roughly 5,000 apps aimed at mental health and wellbeing, and says, \"A lot of those, while they might not be particularly damaging, might not be particularly helpful.\"\nBut experts also recognise the potential for stress tech to reach people in need at a time of cutbacks and waiting lists.\nThe availability of devices, a rapid increase in scope and evolution, it's enough to give you a headache.\nOr maybe, perhaps, make it feel a bit better.","127":"The mayor of Charlottesville said he was \"heartbroken\" at the loss.\nIt is not clear if the death came when a car rammed a crowd of opponents of the far-right rally, injuring several.\nThe \"Unite the Right\" march was called to protest against plans to remove a statue of a Civil War general. A state of emergency has been declared.\nPresident Donald Trump condemned \"in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides\".\n\"The hate and the division must stop right now,\" he told reporters, speaking in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. \"We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation.\"\nVideo posted on social media showed a car ploughing at speed into several slow-moving vehicles, which were surrounded by a densely packed crowd. Emergency services were pictured treating a number of people who were injured.\nSome reports suggest there are as many as 10 people wounded.\nA witness said one girl got \"tore up\" after the car \"backed up and hit again\".\nEarlier, police fired tear gas against demonstrators and said that arrests had been made after a declaration of unlawful assembly at Emancipation Park.\nThe state of emergency allows local authorities to request additional resources if needed, the police department said.\nThe far-right protesters, some waving Confederate flags, carrying shields and wearing helmets, are angry about the planned removal of a statue of Gen Robert E Lee from Charlottesville. Gen Lee commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces in the US Civil War of 1861-65.\nThe New York Times reports that some of them were chanting \"You will not replace us,\" and \"Jew will not replace us.\"\nAnti-racism organisations such as Black Lives Matter have also held marches.\nBy Joel Gunter, BBC News, Charlottesville\nThere were very violent scenes at Emancipation Park and it took some time for the police to intervene.\nBoth sides were throwing bottles and rocks and using pepper spray.\nThe far-right protesters were a mix of different groups with shields and batons and the declaration of a state of emergency seemed to have had a significant impact on them, as they started to dissipate.\nRiot police have been deployed, but tensions remain high, with people screaming at each other and demonstrators still out on the streets.\nShiquan Rah, a 21-year-old demonstrator who had joined the counter-protest, said about the far-right groups: \"These people don't have a message, their message is hate and violence. This is a spiritual war we're in.\nVirginia Governor Terry McAuliffe urged calm tweeting: \"The acts and rhetoric in #Charlottesville over past 24 hours are unacceptable [and] must stop.

We should have collaborated but we hated each other, absolutely hated each other,\" he says.\n\"We did not work together very well at all. We had to get our assistants to talk to each other to get things done - otherwise discussions would go on well after it was time to go home.\n\"She thought I was arrogant. I thought she was aloof and standoffish - but gorgeous.\"\nThe two never considered meeting outside work at that point, says Phil, but later on a friend engineered a drink in a bar in York - and they revised their opinions of each other.\n\"At that point there was no romantic interest, but it grew from there,\" says Phil. And their socialising outside of work was definitely more fruitful than their initial working relationship.\n\"We got married in Las Vegas and have now been together for 14 years!\"\nPhil and Caroline's experience shows that life outside of work can be very different from the \"nine-to-five\".\nAnd their experience is not unusual. One in five of us (22%) have met our partner at work, according to a YouGov poll for the TUC, while a third of us have had a relationship with a colleague at some point.\nYet while some of us may thrive in the office social scene, others prefer to keep their work and personal lives separate.\nIT consultant Peter Smith says though he gets on well with his co-workers, he does not meet them outside the office. \"I spend 10-12 hours with the same people, why would I want to then go out with them in the evening?\n\"I need to be able to relax and unwind and I can't really do that with people from the office. I don't want to talk about work issues,\" he says.\n\"I have friends I see at the weekends and evenings, and my work colleagues who I might go for a quick lunch with, but I try to make sure the two groups don't meet.\"\nBut no matter how much we might try to compartmentalise our lives, some workplace events - like Christmas parties or leaving drinks - can be hard to avoid.\nIf you never go to any of them, your colleagues may wonder if you're rejecting them and then you might be seen as not one of the team, which could be counter-productive.\nIndeed, talking to your colleagues may help your work rate. A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers found that workplace chatter, even the idle kind, can increase productivity.\nThe researchers fitted volunteers with badges containing radio transmitters and microphones, to monitor workers' interactions and see whether they were work or non-work related.\nThey found that those who interacted most with their co-workers had the highest productivity - whether or not they were talking about work or sport.\nAdele Harman, a medical PA with the NHS, says that having previously worked alone, when she joined a team of about 20 she initially resisted socialising. \"But then you realise you need the moral support - and this gives you confidence, it leads to a more productive office,\" she says.\nSasanka Sharma, founder and chief executive of US engineering and IT firm Iscientia, says he makes a point of meeting his team outside work.\n\"Every now and then we have activities planned for the whole team, be it lunch together, outdoor adventure, or just going out as a team after work hours. This builds our relationship, helps me know my employees on a personal level and helps them know me as well.\"\nFor him, as a company boss, there is also a commercial pay-off. \"In today's environment it is hard to retain employees and colleagues unless they have an emotional connection to the company,\" he says.\n\"I would want my employees to be more connected and have a sense of ownership and that can only happen when people work as a team and as one family.\"\nHowever, it is important to be clear that what happens at work gatherings can never be truly separated from the office - so you need to bear this in mind.\nIf you're in a bar with your boss, no matter how informal things seem, you need to remember they are still your boss, so don't say anything to them that you wouldn't normally say in the office - something that may be harder to remember after a few drinks.\nWhile getting a reputation for always being in the pub after work may be something to be avoided, we are social animals and developing links and friendships with co-workers can be useful.\nThese links can help you to find out what's really going on in your workplace, which may help you in your career.\nWhen it comes to after-hours socialising, Phil Dibbs says you don't have to become your co-workers' best friend - but in terms of smoothing your own path at work \"it does help if you get to know them in the round\".\nSomething that certainly worked for Phil and Caroline.","129":"Activist Akeela Ahmed says she uses Twitter to campaign on equality issues.

The gross figure is roughly the cities of Liverpool and Aberdeen put together\"\nReality Check verdict: Mr Nuttall is about right on the net figure but the gross figure is lower than he says, according to the best estimates we have.\nWhen he talks about the net figure, he means the number of people who have come to live in the UK planning to stay for at least a year, minus those who have left for at least a year.\nThe figures for the whole of 2016 will not be released until 25 May, but we know around 596,000 people came to the UK in the year to the end of September 2016 while about 323,000 people left the country, according to the latest set of numbers from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), giving a net figure of 273,000.\nAccording to the most recent set of official figures, the population of Newcastle upon Tyne is 292,883, so these two figures are similar.\nBut Mr Nuttall's second claim is more questionable. He said the number of people moving to the UK was: \"roughly the cities of Liverpool and Aberdeen put together\".\nOfficial estimates suggest that it is lower than that.\nLiverpool's population is 478,580 according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while Aberdeen's is 230,350.\nThe combined total is 708,930, so there is an clear difference between that and the gross immigration figure of 596,000.\nThese migration numbers are estimates based on the international passenger survey.\nHundreds of thousands of people a year are interviewed at airports, sea ports and the Channel Tunnel and asked if they are planning either to enter the UK to stay for at least a year or leave for at least a year, which would make them long-term migrants.\nAbout 4,000 people interviewed a year are long-term migrants. The rest are passengers travelling for shorter periods, such as tourists and business travellers.\nFrom speaking to these 4,000 people, the ONS extrapolates the total numbers of people entering or leaving the UK for at least a year.\nLots of the UK's most important statistics come from surveys like this.\nIt means the figures are estimates and there is a margin of error in them.\nThe ONS is 95% confident that net migration is no more than 41,000 higher or lower than 273,000. Mr Nuttall's Newcastle comparison falls comfortably within this, and is therefore a reasonable comparison.\nHowever, on the gross figure, the ONS is 95% confident that it is no more than 34,000 higher or lower than 596,000.\nTherefore, it is unlikely the number is as high as 708,930, the population of Liverpool and Aberdeen put together.\nUKIP has in the past suggested that the official migration statistics are an underestimate.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter","131":"In his first interview since he fled to the UK last month, the four-star general told the BBC that Mr Museveni's plans should be opposed.\nGen Sejusa fled after claiming that Mr Museveni was grooming his son Muhoozi Kainerugaba to succeed him.\nThe government has repeatedly denied any such plan.\nMr Museveni has been in power since 1986, and elections are due in 2016.\nThe security forces last month raided the offices of two newspapers which published a confidential letter by Gen Sejusa, calling for an investigation into allegations of a plot \"to assassinate people who disagree with this so-called family project of holding onto power in perpetuity\".\nGen Sejusa told BBC Focus on Africa that Mr Museveni was ruling over a \"decadent system\" and \"playing God\" in Uganda.\n\"Who gave Mr Museveni the right to rule over us forever?\" he asked.\nGen Sejusa said Brig Kainerugaba represented a \"national project of Mr Museveni to subvert the existing political system in order to perpetuate himself\".\n\"The central issue is a political monarchy - a life presidency and then transiting [to] a political monarchy,\" he added.\n\"It is a terribly common African story.

These efforts have been increased since the onset of the Ukraine crisis in 2014.\nNow Western media and governmental organisations are stepping up their efforts to reach out to Russian speakers.\nJust last week, the BBC said it was looking at plans for a new Russian satellite TV and video service.\nMeanwhile the EU's European External Action Service (EEAS) is preparing to launch a special anti-propaganda task-force aimed at Russian speakers in the EU and other parts of Eastern Europe.\nIn January the European Parliament had urged the EU to develop \"a communication strategy to counter the Russian propaganda campaign\", in a strongly-worded resolution.\nThe German and US-funded international broadcasters Deutsche Welle and Radio Liberty, as well as Euronews - part-funded by the EU - have also been boosting their Russian operations.\nBut the evidence suggests that these attempts to influence opinion in alien media-spheres are unlikely to make a great impact.\nDuring the Cold War there was intense media rivalry between Russia and the West to influence global opinion.\nIn 2015, Russia significantly increased its spending on RT. The channel's budget rose more than 50%, to 20.8bn roubles (around \u00c2\u00a3202m; $300m).\nThe other arm of the Kremlin's international media operation, the news agency Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today), also got a big rouble boost. It now gets the equivalent of $89m.\nThese increases were needed to partially offset the recent slump in the rouble's value.\nBut they also underline the increasing importance the Kremlin attaches to its international media operations. They now account for 34% of total central government media spending, compared to 25% a year ago.\nWhen President Vladimir Putin visited RT's offices in 2013, he praised its success in helping to break the \"Anglo-Saxon monopoly\" on the international media market.\nNo reliable figures are available for RT's audience worldwide. But evidence from the UK tends to belie Mr Putin's words.\nData from the Broadcast Audience Research Board (BARB) shows that in August RT's average weekly reach was around 450,000 or 0.8% of the total audience. That is some 100,000 less than in June 2012, when BARB started publishing data for RT.\nMoreover, RT is losing out to one of its main international rivals, Al-Jazeera English (AJE). In June 2012, it was marginally outperforming AJE. Now it gets less than half the audience of the Qatar-owned channel.\nBut RT will draw some comfort from the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn has in the past expressed approval of RT and has made numerous appearances on the channel.\nThe picture on social media is somewhat different. On Twitter and Facebook, RT is comfortably outgunned by the international giants, BBC News and CNN. But on YouTube it is the clear market leader, with more than 1.5m subscribers and nearly 1.5bn views on its main channel.\nBut what do YouTube viewers mostly watch on RT?\nMore than any of the other big international broadcasters, RT depends for its large number of views on disaster\/novelty videos with little or no input from its journalists. All of the top 20 on its main YouTube channel (accounting for some 300m views) can be said to fall into this category.\nWhen it comes to videos about major political events its viewership is much smaller. Only a handful of its top 100 videos can be described as \"political\" and only one of them refers to the crisis in Ukraine.\nBut RT and Rossiya Segodnya are by no means the limit of the Kremlin's foreign media operations. It also has the international versions of its main domestic channels, with their powerful mixture of lavish entertainment and emotive news coverage.\nThese are widely believed to have influenced public opinion ahead of Russia's intervention in Ukraine.\nNow there are Western fears that those state-run channels could pave the way for pro-Russian interventions elsewhere, especially the three Baltic states, where they have combined average audience shares of up to 25%.\nLarge ethnic Russian minorities remained in the Baltic states after independence in 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up.\nThere are also concerns about pro-Kremlin comments spreading on social media - many allegedly planted by \"trolls\" paid by the Russian state.\nLatvia and Lithuania have responded to the challenge posed by Russian TV by tightening media regulations and even temporarily banning some channels.\nEstonia, on the other hand, is preparing to launch a new channel aimed at its 350,000 Russian speakers, forming nearly 30% of the population.\nBut with just a fraction of its Russian competitors' funding it is not expected to make a great impact.\nThe head of the Lithuanian public broadcaster has likened ventures of this kind to using \"pitchforks to oppose tanks\".\nThe same might be said of the efforts of Western broadcasters to influence opinion in Russia.\nA recent survey by state-funded pollster VTsIOM and Western academics found that 45% of Russians backed censorship against foreign media. The same survey found that just 2% named foreign media as one of their main sources of information.\nCorrection 18 September 2015: This story was corrected to amend the percentage increase in RT's budget and to note that one of RT's top 100 videos refers to the Ukraine crisis.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The problem is these people were tested positive in competition. That means, months before, you know the date of the test and the approximate time of the test.\n\"So, if you fail an in-competition test, you haven't only failed a drugs test, you have failed an IQ test.\n\"This could be the tip of the iceberg to have so many positives coming in competition.\n\"What is going to convince me is if there is an out-of-competition test that's unannounced, that includes blood testing and which tests for EPO. Then we can hold up our heads high and say we know there's nothing.\"\nBut the head of the Jamaican Olympic Association, Mike Fennell, dismissed Dr Wright's concerns, saying he was \"being dramatic\".\n\"I think that's massively overstating it,\" Fennell said. \"There's no evidence to suggest that it's the tip of the iceberg.\"\nAlthough Dr Wright met with Wada officials during their visit, he was critical, saying they did not spend enough time on the ground in Jamaica.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I have a personal problem in what you can do in 12 hours,\" he said. \"They really came late Monday evening and left first flight Wednesday morning. So they were only really here on Tuesday. And four hours of that was at a dinner function with the Prime Minister.\n\"It's not enough. Remember, it was explained as an extraordinary audit. I would have loved them to have been here for a week, to have got answers to every question, to be able to question people who knew what was happening.\n\"Their intervention has led to the promise of change. If the promises are kept, then we will get there.\"\nFollowing Wada's visit, the Jamaican Minister for Sport, Natalie Neita Headley, vowed to pump more money in to testing to boost the current annual budget of just over \u00a3380,000.\nThat funding - with the help of additional money from Wada - would be used to hire more senior executives to run the anti-doping programme and to hire and train additional drug testers.\nHeadley told the BBC she was currently hiring two extra drug testers, taking the total number of doping control officers to six.\nShe also vowed to increase the number of tests conducted by Jadco, from 300 this year to 400 in 2014, and said the commission was ready to start blood testing its athletes.\nShe also said claims that Jamaica's top athletes had not been tested enough were wrong, pointing to figures released by the IAAF, the body that governs world athletics.\n\"Our athletes, as confirmed by the IAAF, were the most tested in the world of athletics, so to say your athletes weren't tested is not exactly true,\" she said.\n\"I would recognise that the events of the last couple of months would have harmed us tremendously. I recognise that.\n\"I also recognise that what is important is that the country puts all of what is needed in place to beef up a system, bolster your system that where there might be weaknesses you strengthen, where there might be any difficulties that you remove those difficulties.\n\"Though we are experiencing turbulent economic times, the budget of Jadco was increased this year unlike many other areas.\"\nJadco has so far carried out 286 tests in 2013, both in and out of competition. These are in addition to the tests conducted by the IAAF on a pool of 19 elite Jamaican athletes.\nThese tests have taken place in competitions around the world but mainly in Europe and out of competition in the run-up to the Moscow World Championships in August.\nSports officials in Jamaica insist that, while their own testing regime needs to improve, there are no reasons to doubt the performances of top stars like triple Olympic champions Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price.\nJamaican Olympic chief Fennell said he believed some of the positive tests had been caused by contaminated food supplements.\n\"There is a problem worldwide with the use of supplements,\" said Fennell. \"The whole world is induced to use supplements for one thing or another.\n\"Athletes are no different. This is not with a view to cheating and I would put my head on the block and say our athletes do not set out to cheat.\n\"We do have rigorous testing. If you look at the record for this year, you will see our testing record is amazing. Those of our top athletes are on the registered international programmes.\n\"More can be done and you tell me what country in the world where more cannot be done. A country like Jamaica has economic problems and we are doing extremely well with the resources we have, but there's always room for more and we have to make sure we are up to speed.\"\nOne of Jamaica's leading sprinters, Nesta Carter, said athletes understood that the events of the last few months had put him and his team-mates in the spotlight.\n\"I understand why people pay more attention to Jamaica,\" said Carter, who won an individual bronze medal in the 100m in Moscow in August to add to his sprint relay gold from the London Olympics.\n\"It was the same when the US dominated. People said they were on drugs and should be tested. That's a part of the sport and we have to accept that. It's going to hurt fans and athletes because no-one wants to be associated with what's going on.\n\"It's kind of hard to see your fellow mates and people keep pointing the fingers at them and saying they are on drugs when they are not - so you just have to stay clean and do the right thing.\"","136":"The Belfast Telegraph says the officer's family has been left traumatised by the booby-trap bomb planted under his car.\nThe bomb was so sensitive it blew up as soon as it was touched by an Army bomb disposal robot, says the News Letter.\nThe Irish News quotes Supt Gordon McCalmont as saying it was not a pipe bomb but \"something more intricate\".\nThe dailies also concentrate on the Prime Minister's claim that Troubles investigations are disproportionately focused on killings by the security forces when \"90% of deaths were caused by terrorists\".\nThe Belfast Telegraph says Theresa May is appalled by people who \"try to make a business out of dragging our brave troops through the courts\".\nUnionist parties welcomed the Commons intervention, with Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliot telling the News Letter it is helpful that English MPs are now \"taking a keen interest\" in Northern Ireland veterans.\nHowever, a frustrated coroner's snappy challenge to the Ministry of Defence to \"put up or shut up\" over its Troubles-era files gets even more coverage.\nCoroner Brian Sherrard is trying to investigate the IRA murders of 10 Protestant workmen at Kingsmills, County Armagh, in 1976.\nThe Irish News says he will \"not tolerate prevarication\" after it emerged the MOD is considering an application to withhold its Kingsmills files from public disclosure.\nBut it's not bombs or bullets on the front page of the paper, which instead leads with an eight-page special report on the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal.\nAmong the timelines and in-depth analysis of the botched heating scheme, the paper says it has uncovered one RHI firm that is \"paid more than \u00c2\u00a31,000 of public money each week\".

That removed any national competition for the direct delivery of letters.\nOfcom said the \"fundamental\" review would \"ensure regulation remains appropriate and sufficient to secure the universal postal service\".\nThe government sold half of its remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail in June, raising \u00a3750m for the Treasury.\nIn May, Royal Mail reported an increase in full-year profits to \u00a3740m, up 6% from a year earlier.\nThe Department for Business Industry and Skills also outlined its plan to hand 10 million shares - worth about 1% of the company - to employees this financial year.\nGLS employees will be excluded from the scheme, as will employees at joint ventures.\nWorkers must also stay for three years after receiving their share allocation to be able to keep them, unless they retire, take redundancy, leave through illness or die.\nShares in Royal Mail closed down 0.3% at 510 pence per share, valuing the holding being distributed to workers at \u00a351m.\nDivided by 130,100 staff, the shares would be valued at about \u00a3392.","141":"It is making a so-called super-complaint to the railway regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR).\nWhich? said that as many as 47 million journeys a year end in cancellation or delay, and it should be easier for passengers to get their money back.\nThe ORR said it was already working to improve the situation.\nUnder the super-complaint rules, the ORR now has 90 days to respond and to announce whether it will take action.\n\"Millions of passengers are left out of pocket each year, so train companies must do more to put their passengers first and make rail refunds easier,\" said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?.\nAfter questioning 7,000 passengers, Which? said only a third of people who may have been entitled to compensation actually bothered to claim it.\nA similar survey by the passenger group Transport Focus in 2013 found that 88% of affected travellers did not claim.\nIn response, the ORR said it had already introduced a new code of conduct, to make buying a ticket more transparent.\nBut it admitted that passenger awareness of compensation was low.

Experts say it is a fail safe so if the signal is at red, the points are set to shunt the train off the track to protect the main line.\nWhat has made fixing the problem more complicated is the train hit a pylon supporting the overhead power lines. Those lines are now out of action reducing services.\nEngineers will probably have to remove the pylon and then the derailed train and then fix the overhead wires. So it's a big job.\nI'm told that probably won't happen on Friday and the best way to reduce the levels of disruption will be to start that work over the weekend.\"\nGreat Western Railway (GWR) is running more than half its services through the Thames Valley, but services are busier than normal.\nA GWR spokesman apologised for the disruption caused and added: \"We expect to run close to a full service over the weekend, with a small number of changes to the normal timetable.\"\nHeathrow Connect services were suspended and Heathrow Express trains were only running every 30 minutes rather than the usual 15 minutes.\nThere are revised services between Paddington and Swansea, Penzance, Oxford, Greedford and Bedwyn.\nTransport For London has allocated additional buses to affected routes.\nNo passengers were on board when the train derailed and there were no injuries.","143":"What force does the law allow?\nIn England and Wales, anyone can use \"reasonable\" force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. Householders are protected from prosecution as long as they act \"honestly and instinctively\" in the heat of the moment. \"Fine judgements\" over the level of force used are not expected, says the Crown Prosecution Service.\nWhat this means in practice is that someone can claim they attacked in self-defence if they genuinely believed they were in peril - even if in hindsight they were clearly wrong.\nVictims do not have to wait to be attacked if they are in their home and fear for themselves or others. These guidelines also apply if someone, in the spur of the moment, picks up an item to use as a weapon. The law very clearly says that a householder is not expected to weigh up the arguments for and against in the heat of the moment - but they have to show that their actions were reasonable in the moment.\nCan the intruder be chased if they run off?\nIt all comes down to the fundamental question of what was proportionate in the moment and what the householder genuinely believed. If an intruder flees the scene, then at that moment they might not be presenting a threat to the householder any longer. This means that a householder who chases and attacks could no longer be considered to be acting in self-defence. Reasonable force can still be used to recover property or make a citizen's arrest.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has suggested in the past that \"a rugby tackle or a single blow would probably be reasonable\" because these are designed to stop the criminal, rather than to inflict grievous harm.\nWhat is the situation if the intruder dies?\nIt is still lawful to act in reasonable self-defence, even if the intruder dies as a result. However, prosecution could result from \"very excessive and gratuitous force\", such as attacking someone who is unconscious. For instance, the CPS decided not to prosecute one woman who snatched a baseball bat from an intruder and smashed him over the head. Had the woman continued to beat the man to a pulp, after he had already fallen and posed no threat, that would probably be considered as unlawful.\nSo the law is quite complicated?\nIt depends which way you look at it. Defenders of the current position argue that self-defence is exactly the kind of debate that should be left up to juries. In each case, the precise facts will be different and may justify a different response.\nBut that's not very clear, is it?\nThat's the argument from the other side. The Conservatives have repeatedly argued that the law needs to be shifted in favour of the householder to give them certainty that they will not be prosecuted. Most cases that have come before the courts have tended to divide public opinion.\nHow likely is prosecution?\nThere have been very few prosecutions in these circumstances. Between 1990 and 2005 there were 11 prosecutions of people who attacked intruders. Seven of them related to domestic burglaries. One of the cases that was prosecuted involved a man who lay in wait for an intruder and then beat him, threw him into a pit and set him alight.\nBuckinghamshire businessman Munir and Tokeer Hussain were jailed in different circumstances. Hussain had returned home to find that three intruders had tied up his family. He escaped and, with the help of his brother, chased one of the intruders, Walid Saleem. Hussain caught Saleem and hit him so hard with a cricket bat that he inflicted permanent brain damage.\nSaleem was incapable of entering a plea at trial and received a lesser sentence than the man whose house he broke into. It's important to note that the brothers did not plead at trial that they acted in self-defence when they chased and attacked the intruder. The Court of Appeal reduced their sentences but emphasised that the case was very unusual - and included an eyewitness who pleaded with the men to stop attacking the intruder.\nWhat about if someone shoots?\nThe most recent case was that of Andy and Tracey Ferrie. They were in bed when two burglars entered their home. Mr Ferrie fired his (legally-held) shotgun at the men. The couple were arrested but then released without charge.\nThe judge at the intruders' trial said: \"If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.\"\nThe most well-known case is Tony Martin. In 1999, the Norfolk farmer shot dead an intruder in his home. He was jailed for life for murder but the Court of Appeal then reduced that to manslaughter. He served three years in jail.\nWhat do top judges think?\nLord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, said in his 2012 press conference that he thought the law was sound.\nHe said: \"I suspect if any of you have come home to find a burglar in your home, or have been in bed at night --  or indeed having an afternoon snooze and found a burglar in your home - you are not  calmly detached. You are probably  very cross and you are probably  very frightened - a mixture of  both -and your judgment of  precisely what you should or should not do  in the circumstances cannot, as another predecessor of mine, Lord Lane, said, you cannot measure it in a jeweller's scale.  You have to face the reality of how people are and how people react to these situations - and justifiably react.\n\"The householder is entitled to use reasonable  force to get  rid of the burglar and that in measuring whether the force is reasonable or not, you are not doing a paper exercise six months later.  You have to put  yourself in the position of the man or woman who has reacted to the presence of a burglar and has reacted with fury, with anxiety, with fear, and with all the various different emotions  which will be generated, and who has no time for calm reflection","144":"Sheffield council leader Julie Dore said the city could not wait to welcome back the heptathlon winner on Saturday.\nSuggestions about the best way to pay tribute to Ennis's victory include renaming one of the city's squares, to erecting statues in her honour.\nMs Dore said it was important not to rush a decision.\nA civic reception will be held and Ms Dore said she would recommend to councillors that Ennis be given the freedom of the city, the highest honour the council can bestow.\n\"I know people are wanting a long-lasting legacy for Jessica,\" she said.\n\"There's been all sorts of suggestions mentioned, from renaming squares to renaming roads to renaming buildings, all sorts of different things.\n\"We need to sit down with Jessica, her team, her parents and work out between us what's the most appropriate and fitting legacy for Jessica.\"\nMs Dore spoke as a banner celebrating Ennis's achievement was put up on the front of the town hall.\nShe added: \"I think it's a fantastic, incredible, phenomenal achievement.\n\"A young woman, born and bred in Sheffield.

It has been going since 1812 and an estimated three-quarters of Spaniards and thousands of foreigners play each year.\nThe odds are good - around a million people walk away with cash prizes - and El Gordo is the world's biggest lottery in financial terms. It handed out 2.5bn euros last Christmas.\nUnlike other lotteries, players do not choose numbers. They buy a ticket with a 5-digit number on and anyone who has that ticket when the the numbers are called - or, more accurately,sung out by schoolchildrenat a televised event in Madrid - wins a share of the prize.\nBecause of the nature of the system, tickets in a series are often sold by the same vendor, meaning the winners usually come from the same towns.\nThe draw is always held just before Christmas to offer people some festive cheer. In 2011's El Gordo, all 1,800 winning tickets were sold in Granen (population 2,100) in the arid and recession-hit Los Monegros area of Huesca province.\nWinners scooped 400,000 euros per ticket. As the news came in, celebrating residents poured onto the streets to congratulate each other.\nBut spare a thought for Costis Mitsotakis. The Greek filmmaker was the only person in the 70-strong village of Sodeto, near Granen, not to win a prize. Apparently the homeowners' association forgot about him when they were collecting money for a share in a ticket.\nThe EuroMillions lottery is held twice a week across nine European countries - Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.\nAs the stakes are pooled from different countries, the prizes are often life-changing. The biggest winners to date areColin and Chris Weirfrom Ayrshire, Scotland, who bagged 185m euros (\u00a3161m) last July.\nThey said they were \"tickled pink\" at the news and planned to use the money to go travelling. The Weirs have recently found themselves caught up in apolitical spat, however, after they donated \u00a31m to Alex Salmond's SNP party.\nThe Scottish first minister hosted the lucky winners at his official residence days before their donation last year - leading the Labour party to accuse him of misusing government resources.\nThe British have done particularly well in recent EuroMillions draws, taking five of the jackpots this year alone.\nBut France has had the biggest number of jackpot winners since the lottery started in 2004, with 55, followed by Spain (48) and Portugal (42).\nFor the cost of a $1 ticket, one lucky Mega Millions player could be walking away with $640m on 30 March.\nThe way the lottery is set up, the winner will only receive the full prize if they agree to have it paid in instalments over a number of years. Otherwise, they can walk away with a $460m cash prize.\nPlayers pay $1 (63p) for a ticket and must pick five numbers from 1 to 56, plus a Mega number from 1 to 46 to win the jackpot.\nSince the lottery began in 1996, the biggest jackpot has been $390m in March 2007. That prize was split between two winners in Georgia and New Jersey.\nBut winners like Andrew Jackson Whittaker serve to show that money does not always buy happiness.\nThe West Virginia businessman won $315m in 2002, at that time the largest jackpot in history won by a single person. He had a happy family and a successful business when his numbers came up, but within five years he had been arrested twice, robbed several times and had around 400 legal claims against him.\nHe told ABC News: \"You know, my wife had said she wished that she had torn the ticket up. Well, I wish that we had torn the ticket up too.\"","147":"Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey.\nAbout 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg.\nMost of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria.\nOne in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need.\nBritish Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004.\nRecruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production.\nTheir concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC.\nThe questionnaire was sent to members of the British Leafy Salad Association and British Summer Fruits, which represent 90% of growers in their sector.\nThere was a big response. Three-quarters of growers completed the survey, which was carried out between 16 May and 5 June, as harvesting started to peak.\nWe asked if they had enough seasonal workers for the start of the main picking season:\nMeanwhile, 78% of respondents said recruitment had been more difficult than last year, with 20% saying it had been the hardest for years.\nAt Wilkin and Sons in Essex, the picking season for strawberries is in full swing. But this year, they have 20% fewer workers than they would like.\n\"We're managing, but we're not comfortable,\" said joint managing director Chris Newenham.\n\"Our seasonal workers are a critical resource for us to be able to save our crop each year. And the logical extension of not being able to harvest that crop is that we will have to bring our production in from overseas and that's a position none of us want to see. \"\nHe's not the only one. Of those surveyed, 71% said they would consider reducing UK production if there were future restrictions on seasonal workers.\nBritish Summer Fruits has commissioned its own separate report, just published, on the potential implications for its growers, and consumers, of Brexit.\nIt warns that soft fruit prices could rise by up to 50% if the UK relied solely on imports.\n\"It is inconceivable that people who voted to leave the European Union wanted to destroy an iconic and incredibly competitive British horticulture industry,\" said Laurence Olins, chairman of British Summer Fruits.\n\"Failure to secure the future of soft fruit production in the UK will have a negative impact on the economy, family budgets, the nation's health, UK food security and the environment,\" he added.\nSo why doesn't horticulture, now a \u00c2\u00a33bn industry, simply try to employ British workers?\nThe answer is straightforward for Beverley Dixon, from G's Fresh, which employs some 2,500 seasonal workers growing salad crops across large areas of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, as well as other farms dotted across the UK.\n\"We operate in areas of such low unemployment, so here in Cambridgeshire, it's less than 1.5%,\" she said.\n\"So there simply aren't the people available to do the work, added to which UK people tend to want permanent year-round work and this is seasonal work.'\nReliance on migrant workers isn't a specific challenge for the UK, according to David Swales, analyst at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.\n\"If we look at other developed countries around the world, places like Australia and New Zealand, they source labour from the Pacific Islands.\n\"In the US, they source labour from Mexico and the Caribbean countries. So there are a number of places where countries have to go outside their borders to source the seasonal workers that they need,\" he added.\nThe nationalities of these workers have changed over the decades in the UK. There used to be a seasonal agricultural workers scheme which allowed growers and farmers to attract workers from across the world.\nThe industry says it worked and believes it's the obvious solution now Britain has decided to leave the EU.\nDuring a recent select committee inquiry into seasonal labour shortfalls, the government said net migration figures showed that sufficient labour was available in the UK and that there was currently no need for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme for migrants.\nThe BBC survey is hard evidence that recruitment has proved tougher this year, with some shortages reported.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The government places great value on the UK's food and farming industries, both as a crucial component of the UK economy and of the fabric of rural Britain.\n\"We are determined to get the best deal for the UK in our negotiations to leave the EU, not least for our world-leading food and farming industry, which is a key part of our nation's economic success.\"","148":"Smail F and Ibrahim F, reported in local media to be brothers, face charges including terrorist murder.\nThree suicide bombers killed 32 people at Brussels international airport and Maelbeek metro station.\nOn Tuesday, three more suspects in the attacks in Paris in November were arrested in Brussels, officials said.\nThe gun and bomb attacks in the French capital killed 130 people.\nSmail F and Ibrahim F have been linked to a house in the central Etterbeek area of Brussels that was used by suicide bomber Khalid el-Bakraoui, who died in the Maelbeek metro attack, and the arrested Swedish national Osama Krayem, suspected of being el-Bakraoui's accomplice.\nProsecutors say Smail F was born in 1984 and Ibrahim F in 1988.\nThe house in Avenue des Casernes was raided on Saturday but no explosives or weapons were found.\n\"They are charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group, terrorist murders and attempts to commit terrorist murders, as a perpetrator, co-perpetrator or accomplice,\" prosecutors said in a statement.\nBelgian media report that the two brothers knew both Khalid el-Bakraoui and his brother Ibrahim, who blew himself up at the airport along with Najim Laachraoui.\nElder brother Smail F is suspected of renting the Etterbeek flat while his younger brother is alleged to have helped clean the flat, removing evidence before police arrived, public broadcaster RTBF reports. However, other reports indicate that Ibrahim F denies any involvement in the plot.\nWhat is unclear for Belgian investigators is whether further suspects are at large.\nThere are particular concerns over the whereabouts of a backpack allegedly worn on 22 March by Krayem, a Swedish national said to have returned to Europe from Syria last September.\nThe suspect was spotted on CCTV wearing a similar backpack to Khalid el-Bakraoui when they had a brief conversation at Petillon metro station, a few stops away from Maelbeek. While el-Bakraoui blew himself up, Krayem did not.\nKrayem is also thought to have been filmed at a Brussels shopping centre, buying the suitcases used in the airport bombings.\nThe other key arrested suspect is Mohamed Abrini, who police say has confessed to being the \"man in the hat\" - the third airport bomber who fled without detonating his device.\nTuesday's arrests over the attacks on Paris took place after a raid on a house in the Brussels suburb of Uccle.\nNo further details were given.\nBelgian Islamism expert Pieter Van Ostaeyen has warned that the authorities may be dealing with a far bigger jihadist cell than thought.\nHe told Belgian TV on Monday that the Brussels bombings, like the attacks on Paris and on the Brussels Jewish museum in May 2014, were linked to a network run by Paris attacker Abdelhamid Abaaoud and jihadist recruiter Khalid Zerkani.\n\"Potentially there are at least another 60 to 70 members of the Zerkani network still active,\" he warned.\nTwo other suspects, Herve BM and Bilal el-Makhoukhi, are being investigated for participating in terrorist acts.\nBelgian prosecutors revealed on Sunday that Mohamed Abrini had told them that the original plan had been to target France but it was switched to Brussels when fellow Paris attack suspect Salah Abdeslam was arrested in Brussels on 18 March.\nAbdeslam was stopped by police near Ulm in south-western Germany last October. Krayem was with him at the time, using a fake Syrian passport, as was Amine Choukri who was also arrested on 18 March.\nIn a separate development, Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad has obtained a photo of Abdeslam in jail in Bruges. The image shows Abdeslam with a beard, which he did not have before he went on the run last November.\nThe website says (in Dutch) that he is being held in a top security wing of Bruges prison and checked on eight times per hour.","149":"The coach says that Mbia is suspended for their match against France on 30 May after his red card in another friendly against Nigeria last year.\nHe added that Mbia is also due to play for his club Hebei China Fortune a day earlier.\nThe 29-year-old will also miss a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on 3 June against Mauritania.\nMbia was left on the bench by Broos for their last Nations Cup qualifier against South Africa in March.Norwich City's Sebastien Bassong, Marvin Matip and Landry N'guemo also miss out.\nThere is a recall for the Tottenham Hotpsur striker Clinton Njie after recovering from the knee injury that saw him miss both matches against South Africa.\nBroos has called up three locally-based players to his squad for the matches, Mohammed Djetei Union Douala, Coton Sport's Aaron Mbimbe and Jonathan Ngwem of Unisport.\nCameroon are currently top of their 2017 Nations Cup qualifying pool with eight points and one point ahead of Mauritania, with only the group winners guaranteed a place at the finals in Gabon.\nCameroon squad:\nGoalkeepers: Andre Onan (Ajax, Netherlands), Guy Roland Ndy Assembe (Nancy, France), Fabrice Ondoa (Tarragona, Spain)\nDefenders: Allan Nyom (Watford, England), Nicoals Nkoulou (Marseille, France), Aurelien Chedjou (Galatasaray, Turkey) Henri Bedimo (Lyon, France) Ambroise Oyongo (Montreal Impact, MLS) Adolphe Teiku  (Sochaux, France) Jonathan Ngwem (Unisport Bafang), Mohammed Djettei (Union Douala) Aaron Mbimbe (Coton Sport Garoua)\nMidfielders: Franck Kom (Etoile du Sahel, Tunisia), Eyong Enoh (Standard Liege, Belgium) Georges Mandjeck (Metz, France) Sebastien Siani (KV Oostende, Belgium)\nForwards: Vincent Aboubakar (FC Porto, Portugal), Eric-Maxime Choupo-Moting (Schalke, Germany),Benjamin Moukandjo (Lorient, France), Jacques Zoua (Ajaccio, France), Anatole Abang (New York Red Bulls, MLS) Karl Toko (Sochaux, France), Clinton Njie (Tottenham Hotspur, England), Edgar Sali (St Gallen, Switzerland)"},"summary":{"0":"The prime minister of the southern African kingdom of Lesotho has fled to South Africa, alleging a coup by the army and saying his life is in danger.","1":"Former Labour minister Jack Straw is to chair an inquiry into the governance of the House of Commons amid a row over the hiring of a new Commons Clerk.","2":"A photographer has recreated his grandfather and great uncle's daring 2,200km escape from a prisoner of war camp on camera.","3":"Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a shock 13-9 defeat by Stuart Bingham in the last eight of the World Snooker Championship.","4":"A bid to give Northern Ireland designated special status within the European Union (EU) following Brexit has been defeated in the European Parliament.","5":"The Night Tube will lead to a rise in sexual offences and rowdy behaviour on the Underground, according to an internal risk assessment by Transport for London.","6":"Rafa Benitez is a great manager but he is not a magician, which is why it is going to be touch and go whether he can keep Newcastle up.","7":"State pension age increases that discriminate against women born on or after 6 April 1951 have been labelled \"unjust\" by Westminster's youngest MP.","8":"The families of the 11 men killed in the Shoreham air crash have been given a site to create a temporary steel arch memorial where ribbons can be tied while a permanent one is planned.","9":"Junior doctors in England will take part in five consecutive days of strikes next month as they ramp up their opposition to a new contract.","10":"The Israeli cabinet has approved the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of US-backed efforts to resume the peace process.","11":"Korean Air has said guidelines will be revised for crew to react \"firmly and actively against in-flight violence\", after facing criticism for its handling of an on-board incident.","12":"Victims of the Troubles have said they are more optimistic agreement can be reached on new agencies to examine the past.","13":"Ivan Cavaleiro's late penalty gave Wolves victory over Bristol City, condemning the Robins to a fourth successive defeat.","14":"The widower and children of a teacher murdered by a student have lost their legal challenge against a coroner's decision not to call pupils as witnesses at a forthcoming inquest.","15":"USA's Simone Biles has gone from star to superstar at the Rio Olympics, with four gold medals.
