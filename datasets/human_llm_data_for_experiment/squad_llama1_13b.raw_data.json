        "In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future. On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: \"You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see",
        "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system, the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",

Hellen was the son of Deucalion who ruled around Phthia in central Greece. The Parian Chronicle mentions that when Deucalion became king of Phthia, the previously called Graikoi were named Hellenes. Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai/Greeks (Meteorologica I.xiv) a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt. However, according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece.

        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played",

        "The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election",

John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by",

The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass in",

Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924.

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.

A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion.

During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.

Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer, it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a",

At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to",
        "Valencia is a bilingual city: Valencian and Spanish are the two official languages. Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language. Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public",
        "The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments.

The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \"On this",

Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent\u2019s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment.

Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major",

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi). Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Arm\u00e9e performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions.

The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart.",

As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.",

        "In modern particle physics, forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be \"fundamental interactions\".:199\u2013128 When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero.

        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as",

Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels",

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey",

An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience.

He believed that the mind was a tabula rasa (blank slate) at birth and the sole means of obtaining knowledge of the outside world were our five senses. An important contribution to empiricism came in the late 19th century from Herbert Spencer. In his principle of \"verification,\" Spencer held that any idea should be held to the test. If it could not be tested then it had no place in science. Spencer's ideas have influenced modern philosophers and psychologists as well as scientists. Today, experimental methodologies using quantitative data have replaced qualitative methods. Scientific knowledge relies upon observational and experimental data.\nDeductive reasoning is based on a system of logic in which the conclusion is directly imp",

        "Kublai's government faced financial difficulties after 1279. Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury and put Kublai into major debts. Kublai's government was forced to raise additional funds to pay for an ongoing war with the rebellious Song loyalists in Thailand-Cambodia. Kublai adopted the Chinese imperial tradition of revenue-sharing with his subordinate elite, which caused tensions among his Chinese administration. It was recorded that some high-ranking Chinese officials had protested against this practice. Nevertheless, during the Yuan period, the number of high-ranking officials in China diminished sharply in comparison to the Mongol period. Most Mongols were gradually forced out of the civil service when Kublai came to the throne. By 1328, Mongols only occupied fourteen positions among the top 120 Mongol and Chinese officials.",

During his attempt, he came across an ambush led by William Marshal, where he was wounded and had to fall back with no result except an increased respect for the ability of Marshal and his military skills. John was never comfortable with the idea that he would one day be facing him in real battle; this was just a battle of words with the potential to lead to a battle with swords and arrows, and it was becoming increasingly unlikely that John would out-slip William without a fight.

        "The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century, with compositions by Josquin des Prez, Johann Ockeghem and other masters. Their use of chords with multiple harmonic functions within polyphonic textures was a precursor to early forms of tonality. It was not until the early 16th century, in music by Palestrina, that these chords became diatonic.\nA diatonic scale is one which is based on a system of whole steps and half steps that define the patterns of the notes\u2019 pitches and their harmonies. Most western music uses the scale of twelve equal intervals (a half step is the distance between two pitches that are a half tone apart, or two notes that are an octave apart). There are seven degrees in this mode, each of which is a member of the diatonic scale, and these degrees are separated",

        "Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to be able to agree on one thing: Lutherans and Roman Catholics agree on much when it comes to Mary's theological significance. Yet for many reasons one must continue to emphasize the points of difference. This article focuses on one of those differences: how the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Assumption of Mary (as well as her status as Queen of Heaven) relates to the theology of Luther's own Mariology at the end of his life. For Luther, even though he does not explicitly mention Mary in his famous Smalcald Articles of Concord (1537), an article dealing with images and idols already sets the stage for his later Christology when he affirmed the idea of the Incarnation: \u201cthe second commandment means that Christians should not make or give any kind",

Consequently, this first section can be applied only in case of employment. Second, the equal treatment must be done with workers based in the country.

However, by simply proposing \u201cwater,\u201d Thales offered a view that was not at all incompatible with the dominant mythological or theological theories of his time.\nThales\u2019s theory can be argued to be the direct result of his unique perception of the world.

And not because there were no attempts, but as a result of the political circumstances. Ottoman madaris have always been closely tied to the Turkish Sultanate. So they had to be careful in what they were saying and teaching. And they had to be very cautious. For epistemological issues were not only sensitive but often very critical.

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent by Congress, whereas Madison approved the very same proclamations. The most prevalent accounts assert the two Virginian Founders' differing views of separation on religious grounds; Madison was a Christian who embraced a strong connection between morality and religion, while Jefferson was an irreligious political moralist who saw religion as a threat to republican government. This article, however, focuses on the foundations of Madison's constitutional thinking to challenge this common assumption. The article argues that the separation debate was more nuanced than its standard rendering. Madison's constitutional sensibilities and Jefferson's political moralism did not reflect differences in their religious identities or beliefs. Rather, they reflected how Madison and Jefferson employed political philosophy to address the relationship between morality and society",

However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot opposition to this proposal and a feeling grew in the Turkish Cypriot community that the British might give greater support to the Greek Cypriots. British policy during this period was largely an attempt to gain time, and avoid any confrontation between the two communities, believing that a united Cyprus could not be created without agreement between Greeks and Turks.\nIn May 1959, a UN report proposed constitutional reforms, which it saw as a possible means of achieving agreement among the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The report was immediately denounced by all the Greek Cypriot parties, which were still determined to achieve Enosis (Union of Cyprus with Greece).

In quantum field theory, all such gauge bosons are created and destroyed as virtual particles. We take these bosons as basic reality where we can measure energy and momentum for real, observable particles.\nThis has a profound impact: First, in many-particle quantum field theory, the number of particle-antiparticle pairs created by a gauge boson of a given polarization is determined by the value of the electric charge of the gauge boson. Second, when the number of these pairs differs by an odd integer, we are faced with the possibility of cancellation.

The two South Slavic languages, which can be considered in terms of a single continuum extending across Serbia and Croatia, have had different names in past centuries, which were used interchangeably depending on the historical circumstances and the author.\nBeyond the question of terminology,",
        "Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of Norway and also on Iceland, which was uninhabited until this time. The Irish in Ireland were still pagans, but Christianity was becoming dominant in Scandinavia. Irish monks were active all over the world and brought Christian teaching wherever they went, and monks from mainland Europe introduced Christianity to Scandinavia. Vikings could be Christians as well as pagans, but they had problems understanding that God could only be one with three forms.\nIrish missions to Scandinavia from Iona started in the 6th century, and by the 8th century Bishop Dicuil of Dublin wrote a textbook on cosmography which he titled Tractatus de Locis Sanctis, or the 'Treatise on the Holy Places'. He described in detail",

This force numbered the 1st Corps (X) of Patrice de Mac-Mahon, duc de Magenta, with 32 battalions and 6 squadrons; the 2nd Corps (XI) of Edmond Le B\u0153uf of 35 battalions and 7 squadrons; the 3rd Corps (XII) of Abel Douay with 28 battalions and 8 squadrons, the 5th Corps (XIII) of Jean Auguste Deckers with 10 squadrons, the Imperial Guard artillery under Colonel Charles Ragon d'Armigny,",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the UK tested 1,300 different nuclear weapons in 21 different locations. One of the most egregious examples of damage occurred in Australia in 1952 during an operation known as Hurricane.\nThe operation involved a series of nuclear tests at two locations\u2014Maralinga and Emu\u2014carried out by the British, who called on the assistance of Australian troops. As the Guardian notes, Maralinga has since become internationally recognized as an ecological disaster. The Guardian also notes that Australia\u2019s own government has acknowledged the full extent of the damage the testing wreaked on the Australian and Aboriginal populations.\nThis article (New Zealand Study Claims Nuclear Testing May Have Altered Humanity\u2019s Genetic Code) is a free and open source.",
        "However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of the development of science and mathematics, that is the case of the development of mathematics and natural sciences in a dialectical manner, i.e. in a manner when mathematics or theory develops, not only on the basis of empirical observations or on the basis of theory, but also in a mutually complementing one way process. This is an example of non-arbitrary and non-metaphysical asymmetry which can also be found in a dialectical theory of evolution and social change theory based on that dialectics. This is not metaphysical because it is a process of theory development in various fields which is based on theory and empiricism at the same time, not only empiricism or theory, but based on both.\nHowever, there is another question. In the natural sciences, there must",
        "Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer discuss the HDI from the perspective of data error in the measure. They ask how many countries need to have more data error in their measures, when this error affects the rank or the HDI value for a country relative to all the other countries ranked on that measure. Changes in position have an impact in terms of countries\u2019 behavior, they say.\nRank is particularly sensitive to some data errors, including inequalities, the under-estimating of gross national income (GNI) and the under-estimating of life expectancy; the more sensitive it is, the more data error is likely. In relation to the rank, it is not just the relative change in GNI or life expectancy that matters, it is particularly how countries move up and down that matters.\nWolff, Chong and Auffhammer also stress the importance of having a broad",
        "Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who was the key figure in gaining independence from Spain\nSpanish Conquest and Mexican Colony\nWhen the Spaniards defeated the Aztecs at the battle of Otumba in 1521, it was the first step in expanding Spanish control over the territory that is now known as Mexico. Over the next century, the Spanish spread out and occupied the entire territory, killing resisting Indians or forcing them into Christian missions. However the Spanish did not try to rule in the way that the Aztecs did. The Spaniards imposed taxes on their subjects but otherwise left them alone to go about their business. Unlike the Aztecs, they did not force their new subjects to work in the fields or in mines.\nIn this way, the Spaniards were able to establish a new colonial",
        "A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated \"Two major groups were identified by PCA analysis, termed the Ashkenazi Jewish and European clusters.\"\n\nAlthough Jews were largely excluded from government positions in many European countries (see History of the Jews in Europe: Blood libels), they were admitted to the lower middle-class of European society, and by the end of the 17th century were granted freedom of employment and residence in most of the western areas of Europe. At this time, most European Jews spoke the languages of the Christian populations around them, often as their first language, and adopted Christian cultural elements.\n\nFrom the 1880s, Jews engaged in significant self-segregation; they concentrated in their own neighbourhoods, attended separate schools, frequented Jewish entertainments, married only among themselves, and saw their rabbi for life-cycle transactions",
        "The Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty whose capital later shifted to Vijayanagar (a.d 1330-1646), a kingdom founded by Harihara and Bukka. Vijayanagar is one of the greatest of South India. At the height of its splendour, the empire extended almost from the southernmost point of India to the extreme north. Vijayanagar stretched over the whole of the present Indian state of Karnataka into Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. After a long and glorious reign, Vijayanagar was ravaged in 1565 by the army of Muslim ruler of Golconda, the Nizam Shah.\nMysore state: The Mysore state was established in 1399 A.D",
        "Fourth, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law \"as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive\". It is generally agreed that the interpretation of domestic law in this context should not be made by a national court by way of a declaration of invalidity or otherwise, without reference to the other national courts. Such reference, it has been suggested, should be made pursuant to a preliminary question raised by a national court which might be designated to hear such a case, although it has also been proposed that such a court should not necessarily have an exclusive preliminary jurisdiction. It is difficult to see the merits of a system permitting a national court which has accepted jurisdiction to try a case in which the validity of a domestic law derives from EU primary or secondary source, however remote this may seem to be (for example in the case of the \"indirect\" actions referred to in para. 30 above",
