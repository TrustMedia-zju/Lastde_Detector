If evaded, the virus starts infecting and multiplying, and it takes a little while for the immune system to notice. When it does though\u2026 it\u2019s war. First the innate system notices and begins to attack. White blood cells eat, spray acid, and rip themselves apart to deploy DNA webs. Macrophages join and attack. Inflammatory processes are activated. Complement proteins flood the area. Natural killer cells execute any cells that don\u2019t look healthy. Debris accumulates, including virus parts.

While people are getting that it\u2019s a retrovirus and inserts its DNA into cells to infect them, it\u2019s not like cells have infinite life. Effectively we have antiretroviral medications that target different steps in the process where HIV binds to and hijacks our cells. That includes preventing it from attaching to cells, keeping it from insert its DNA, etc. these drugs fall into different classes and generally most cocktails (most people take three drugs in one pill but there\u2019s some exception). The standard backbone targets reverse transcriptase, then that\u2019s paired with a protease inhibitor, a fusion inhibitor, an integrase inhibitor, etc. Eventually after we keep it from replicating long enough you reduce the amount of free virus in the blood below the level that our current",
        "How and why can some metals like copper be antibacterial? It is important to remember that bacteria and cells aren't like us. Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage. Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth. The second big thing to",
        "How did remote places in Asia and Africa not succumb to the same wave of disease and death that the Native Americans did? Starting in the early Edo period, a new Yokai (Demon) appeared in Japan: the [Korori](https://monster.fandom.com/wiki/Korori?file=Korori.JPG). A tricky monster that breathed a foul breath spreading an invisible sickness that afflicted entire households and sometimes took whole villages. We call it Cholera today, and the 1862 outbreak in Edo killed hundreds of thousands. It was brought entirely due to contact with traders from the west. But of course it didn't have the same total devastation effect that was seen in the Americas and there are a number of reasons for this. Native Americans were uniquely susceptible to diseases from Eurasia because their immune systems were primed differently than Eurasian people's. Specifically, when your immune system is developing your body can",
        "how can insects survive a slap from humans, a creature that's gigantic compared to them A matter of scale. Resistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section. The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*. But area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry. Imagine an ant being the size of an elephant. All its dimensions would be roughly multiplied by something like 500, the strength of its legs by 500^2 = 250,000 but its weight by 500^3 = 125,000,000\u2026 and the poor beast would break down under its own weight.

Communication and social activity comes naturally to both of us. This isn't true of most animals a dolphin is likely to encounter. Most sea animals - fish, cephalopods (like octopus and squid) and sharks aren't social at all, and most aren't intelligent. They have either no interest or no capacity to interact with anyone - in the case of fish, dolphins likely just see them as food, in the same way most of us view a chicken. The only other intelligent, social animals a dolphin is likely to ever meet is other ceteceans (whales and dolphins) and humans. Whales are social, intelligent animals, but aren't quite as smart as humans or dolphins. I wouldn't be surprised if dolphins had tried to communicate with whales and sort-of succeeded -",

There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake himself up during the night so he can exercise to get his heart rate up again. Otherwise, he could die in his sleep. EDIT: AI fact check: The story you might be thinking of is about Marco Pantani, a legendary Italian cyclist who had severe bradycardia. While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night. While there are reports of him occasionally using a stationary bike at night to manage his condition, it wasn't a regular practice. In fact, he",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions",
        "How do babies learn a language when they are not taught it in a structured manner? These answers may be correct, but they do not have much linguistic basis. Babies are born with systems that help them learn language. One of these is Universal Grammar. Universal Grammar is the idea that all languages share the same grammar basics, and everyone (apart from those with extreme language disabilities) is born knowing those basics. This is a widely accepted theory from the famous linguist Noam Chomsky. However, the system has to be \u201cpowered on\u201d. Babies need exposure to language in order to actually develop language. They \u201cknow\u201d the basics, and, in their early years, babies are immersed in one or more languages.

Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. This is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains.

I think this is a bit of an over generalization. Yes some shoes are extremely narrow for the sake of fashion but these are typically shoes meant to be worn for shorter periods of time like high heels or maybe a narrow men\u2019s dress shoe. Most every day shoes are not cramming people\u2019s feet into tiny little spaces. If your shoes are doing that, you need to either move up a size or find a different brand.

Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with. A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during. Spiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses. Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever",

I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. *",

        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They mention that episodic memories usually start around 3-4 years of age. Some people mentioned how memory is linked to language, but this isn't proven. If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones.

They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate.

Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference.",

Most of them suck at it compared to animals that live in the water. Humans don't have an \"optional swimming feature\". We instinctively know how to do a very laborious paddle. When people \"learn to swim\" it has to do with training them to be better at it. For example, the body is (usually) naturally buoyant, but if you position yourself certain ways in water you still sink.

And while it\u2019s technically possible that there could be life that\u2019s not carbon-based, it\u2019s probably unlikely. This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y\u2019know, live.

When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain.

This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus.

If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise. But, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still",

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed. It passes through much quicker and everything in it will be absorbed much",

There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it.

This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering.

These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their",

Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white.

One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain. Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got. Humans have larger brains than other primates, and a similar neuron density, so we've got a lot of neurons AND a lot of brains. Minke whales have a brain",

Then, it decides to shock itself awake and do something else with its brain for a while. Maybe this goes on for hours. But for my interest, I just want to know - Does this happen only while human body is awake, or does this also happen in some way when the human body is sleeping. If it does, how should we call it? Like \"h",
        "I don't understand how a fish can get into a lake. eli5 This is a age old question and there are several possible answers for each case. Some fish such as Carp, Perch and Tilapia are able to enter fresh water environments from the ocean as early as the embryonic stage. Others such as Bull Sharks are able to tolerate a considerable amount of fresh water. Fresh water fish can survive temporary exposure to salt water, however these fish can die if they are continuously exposed to seawater so it is unusual to see one in the ocean.\nSo you mean that some fish are born or evolved specifically in certain environment and certain water. They can't survive long in such different environment unless they were specifically adapted to such different environment? Is there such thing called \u201cgenetic\u201d water which have specific water composition?",

It\u2019s just that, by putting Sodium in front of the word \u2018Fluoride\u2019 on the toothpaste tube, it tells the body that it is an ionic compound rather than the elemental form.

        "How is coffee healthy while other uppers like cocaine are bad for you? They work differently. Caffeine blocks your brain's ability to pick up on the signal for adenosine, which is what signals sleep. This happens whether you smoke it or drink it.\nCocaine blocks other signaling pathways (like dopamine) in the brain to keep your brain buzzing and your heart speeding, which is what causes addiction.\nThe problem with caffeine is tolerance. The first time you drink a cup of coffee, you can get stimulated. The next time you drink a cup, it won't have quite the same effect because your brain blocks adenosine a little more efficiently (because your brain is able to build up some tolerance).\nTolerance also happens with alcohol (see How does the brain detect alcohol?), but it's much easier to kick c",

For instance the pores in our skin will slow down production of oil, the production of sweat etc. The same can be said for our sense of smell and our sense of taste. These are areas that will also slow down. Older folks are known for their over use of perfume or cologne to mask their natural body odor. It will be difficult for anyone to explain to the elderly, why they seem to give off a more strong body odor then younger folks do.

Many patients don't realize that there is something they could do about it rather than putting up with the pain. In Chinese Medicine, knee pain in most cases can be attributed to a few common causes. The goal in Chinese Medicine is to figure out why your knee pain is occurring and to fix it so that you could lead a productive pain free life. The common causes can be broken down into a few simple groups: imbalance in movement, imbalance in structure and imbalance at the point of contact between the knee and the ground in relation to the ankle and foot.\nBoth of these im",

This is the chemical structure that gets passed around from your mouth, throat, stomach, and eventually ends up in your brain. It is a depressive and disinhibiting in nature.

        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time.\nIn Ancient Rome, Bloodletting as a way to heal was in high use. This can be seen by an example. Claudius was diagnosed with epilepsy in 25 AD, and the only \u201ctreatment\u201d was Bloodletting, which was believed to be the correct treatment for epilepsy in Ancient Rome. Therefore, it is clear that this was a prevalent medical theory during Ancient Roman times.(History, 2019) There is a similar example by Alexander of Tralles, who believed that Bloodletting is the answer to epilepsy. The idea that bloodletting can heal may have been passed down through the centuries through texts like Tralles book, where he described epilepsy and possible treatments.(Kh",

There are several explanations for how you lose weight in your sleep ranging from fat cells shrinking to you peeing yourself in the middle of the night causing you to lose weight.\nI remember listening to a podcast by Chris Masterjohn on this topic. The main argument is that when you go to sleep your body runs low on glycogen and goes into what is called a fasting metabolic state. In this state your body begins to mobilize fat for energy.\nEssentially when you eat you are giving your body the best options for energy sources. First your body breaks down carbohydrates and turns into glucose. Glucose is your primary source of energy in your body.

The difference in weight is 10 folds i.e. 120kg \u2013 20kg = 100kg. But if we compare their cardiovascular capacity i.e. the heart, it is not fair to just compare the size of the adult heart to the child heart. This comparison is not a level playing field. What the comparison should be is\nChild heart x 10\nBut the adult has 10 x more muscle and ",
        "why do humans require so many types of food to be healthy when many animals can eat one thing? Humans (and all other things) require certain parts of each food group to be healthy.\nCarbohydrates provide energy, vitamins, and minerals.\nProtein makes us build muscles and help our brains to work properly.\nVitamins help protect us from diseases and keep us healthy.\nMinerals helps keep us healthy, too.\nFat helps with keeping your cells full and helps your brain stay healthy.\nAll of these things are important for your body to grow and to stay healthy.\nEven if there were one food that contained everything that we need to grow and stay healthy, eating only one thing would be very boring. Our body needs food to stay healthy. Eating everything is very complicated and confusing to keep track of what you need.",
        "when we improve our cardio, what is it that actually changes within our body for us to be able go from running our first mile to say 10 miles?\nIt improves our lung capacity which means, how much oxygen we can actually take in during our exercise or if you think of it in general running, walking, doing sport, anything that is cardio related oxygen consumption, the amount of oxygen that we can actually take into our body through our lungs.\nAnother interesting one for me to learn was ventilation so basically our breathing technique the amount of breaths of air can actually take in during a certain period of time.\nI always thought to myself, do you know, that running actually makes you lose weight, you would think that, yeah, we're working our body up to a point of sweating through all that fat, but in fact, your body actually makes a hormone or a chemical called glycogene",
        "Why does our body start deteriorating once we grow old? Why can't our cells just newly replicate themselves again? Many of us wonder about this.\nOne thing I've come to observe based on my experiences is that, we do replicate ourselves.\nHave you tried to remember someone else\u2019s birthday party last year? Like how can you remember who else was present, what food they ate, and many other details.\nWhen the memories of previous birthday parties came to me, I asked myself, is this really mine? I've never been involved in these things for years, and now when I know about them, I'm not even involved in these things. Didn't have the slightest idea last year about some important person's birthday.\nAll the time, I wonder if the life I'm living today is just a flashback or a replay of what happened long time ago, and all",
        "Why do human hips go bad so randomly? You\u2019d think runners and other athletes would get bad hips pretty often, but the reality is that they get worse much more slowly than non-athletes. I\u2019ve written about hip pain in athletes before (see here, here, here, and here). This post will be a bit different \u2026. This post will talk more about how and why arthritis may develop to affect a human hip later in life. Arthritis (and the hip joint in the body) is really complicated. I hope to introduce a few of the more common misconceptions (and a few concepts I think deserve more emphasis.)\nI will also give a few more examples of arthritis in runners and cyclists. I hope these examples will give a better overall sense of how hip arthritis can manifest, and maybe even help you better understand how a runner\u2019s life",
        "Why will drinking 6 liters of water in 3 hours kill you? The same way when you eat lots of super salty food and then drink lots of water. Your body cannot expel the excess water fast enough. The water that your body doesn't expel comes out of your cells, which makes your cells swell up and explode. It's literally the same with your body (explosion of cells) and burst blood vessels (explosion of blood cells)..\nBurning fats: water has zero calories which allows you to burn more fat than other beverages. The more you drink the better you burn fat and build muscles Water, which is mostly the liquid you want to drink as a muscle builder, has zero calories making it the better beverage to use throughout the day. Not only is it a drink that is both refreshing and delicious, but water also enhances both memory and attention,",
        "How does your body burn 2000 calories a day, but you have to run a mile to burn 100 extra calories? Not just me, right? But how are we to burn the extra calories, or get rid of the fat with something so easy. Yes, we're lucky to have exercise at our disposal, but it doesn't always solve our problem of getting rid of that extra fat.\nIf you take some time to find out about the way your body stores fat, you will have an idea about how to get rid of it (burn it) once you have a bit of knowledge on the science behind fat storage. Now, I'm not a scientist, and I can't name a single bone or muscle in your body, but I can tell you where the fat is stored and why it is so hard to get rid of.\nTo get you started, I have a few things you",
        "Why aren\u2019t our bodies adapting to our more sedentary lifestyles by reducing appetites? Because evolution doesn't work like that.\nWriting his commentary on the recent study suggesting that it's not the quantity of food we eat, but the quality of the foods we eat that seems to lead to weight gain, Charles Q. Choi reports a finding that may help explain the phenomenon:\nOverall, the results suggested that the increase in obesity was the result of a relatively small rise in the quantity of calories consumed by each person and a shift in the quality of the food Americans consumed.\nSo why don't our bodies adapt to our lifestyles by reducing appetites? Because evolution doesn't work like that:\nIn another study, researchers analyzed genetic data from 7,000 people and compared the genes of 3,000 of them to",
        "why do we get sweaty palms if we're doing something dangerous like climbing? Isn't that counter-productive? Similarly, do we really slip on banana peels?\nHaving sweaty palms indicates that you're scared by the situation. It's a way to communicate this to your brain and the outside world, which has a secondary effect in that other people can read your fear and will often stop doing dangerous stuff if they see it. Humans are built this way- it's what makes us social creatures. (Early man needed to cooperate with group). We see this play out today, for example, between a hiker group and a mountain lion. Both will do the same thing- the hikers will start waving their arms and clapping- which is a way people in most primate species (including humans) communicate aggression. The lion, which naturally won't",
        "if a human being was born in the wild and left alone. When this person grows to be able to think, would they think using a language. Or would they naturally use their senses, but also, do they need some form of language.\nIf a person could only use one sense, which sense should I use?\nIf it didn\u2019t matter which sense, then let\u2019s say you should use all of your senses to get an overall understanding of what is going on. So you should use all five senses \u2013 sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch.\nSo which is best?\nLet\u2019s see, I have to have sight. I have to see the danger.

        "How do doctors treat severe over-hydration (like the famous water drinking contest)? Doc here. TLDR- fix is simple.\nToxin-induced over hydration is one of the leading cause of serious health emergencies in the world. When a person consumes a lot of water, a series of events start occurring in his body. Initially, body tries to increase its water intake to match up the pace of sodium washout and as a reaction it induces diuresis. However, the diuresis in turn induces a massive fluid shift from extracellular spaces to the intracellular spaces with resultant hyponatremia. Due to this sodium reabsorption is inhibited resulting in a further increased fluid shift. Therefore, the vicious cycle of hyponatraemia and diuresis is initiated which if not kept in check becomes extremely dangerous.\n",
        "What is \"empty calories\"? I have an apple. It's filled with sugars, carbohydrates, vitamins, nutrients, and goodness. On the one hand, from the perspective of my metabolism, this is a \"good thing\", giving me energy. On the other hand, if I don't use it, then this stuff is probably going to get converted into fat and then stored. So... does it really matter how I feel about consuming sugars? Probably.\nBrowsing a couple of studies, I'd say that yes, we should be looking a little more critically at how those empty calories make us feel.\nI found a few that focused specifically on the effects of fructose on mood:\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/sciencedirect/ ... d=3436490\nThe \"Fructose-induced mood",
        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip?\nThis is the question that has confused a lot of people: Why is it that drinking salty water makes you more thirsty and needing more water but a hospital is able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip?\nIf you ask this question to most people, they will answer you something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t really understand the chemistry of this, but the saline drip is the opposite of the sugar intravenous solution doctors give people in hospitals, and those solutions don\u2019t really affect the patient. I always knew it was the sugar.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s happening when you drink water?\nWhen you eat food, your body needs water to help process that food. Therefore if you eat a large meal, such as at a",
        "Is it possible to see what ethnicity/race someone is just by looking at organs. For starters, race and ethnicity are different things: Race is a classification of people based on their physical characteristics; ethnicity means a group of people having a common and distinctive culture...but sometimes, their body can tell you the same things! The skin, eyes, hair, and other organs of a person can be identified by certain features in the DNA. Some, while less pronounced, do exist and have been scientifically recorded. So with more or less data, how far can you tell? Well, just check out this chart.\nImage by http://www.southbeachstar.net\nSo just looking at someone's eyes can tell you whether they are Native American or African.

        "When someone gets pregnant while on birth control and then continues taking it daily until realizing they are pregnant, how does this not ruin the baby?\nI do not see this situation being a good thing.\nIt's a hormonal IUD (aka ParaGard) that's inserted in your uterus, so you don't necessarily think about it when you're taking the pill or have a vaginal ring. It is not going to ruin your baby when you get pregnant, it's just like taking the pill, although you're having a baby.\nIt takes 5-7 days to implant. You\u2019re in the danger zone for the longest time if you decide to remove it when you\u2019re pregnant. I\u2019d say the chance is low but your baby is not in any danger.",
