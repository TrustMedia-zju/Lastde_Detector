        "why fish always orient themselves upright (with their backs to the sky, and belly to the ocean floor) while living in a 3d space-like environment. In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the",
        "How do apes like chimps and gorillas have extraordinary strength, and are well muscled all year round - while humans need to constantly train their whole life to have even a fraction of that strength? Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing. Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. Humans are specialized in... well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances. Our arms can't easily haul our body weight up a tree or be used for walking, but can accurately throw things, build tools. Once humans started building tools natural selection greatly preferred the most nimble, flexible hands and arms that could make better tools, and larger brains",

What we didn't know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups.

First, the way that probiotics support your health does not require colonization. In the past it was believed that you would take probiotics and those would \u201cgrow\u201d inside your GI tract and that was it. Although we still have a lot to learn, we now know that most probiotics (if not all) don\u2019t actually colonize (remain) your body. They only remain there for as long as you take them. In medical school we don\u2019t really learn that much about probiotics and a lot of research is fairly new so a lot of doctors just now basic information on them.

Whereas a younger person\u2019s kidneys and liver works in a 16 hr period older people\u2019s kidneys and livers work 24/7 which cause people to get up at night to go to the bathroom as an example. The skin is another way for the body to get rid of toxicity in the body just like the liver and kidneys do. When their efforts are not sufficient even in a 24 hr day then smelly toxic products will be sweated out through the skin throughout the 24 hr day no matter what a person does regarding activity. This drastically changes a person\u2019s personal body odor to that of a stinky old person odor. Often older people will say they have not done anything so they don\u2019t need to bath or shower. Yet they do for this very reason. It is no longer just the armpits, now",

You're constantly losing water. You're losing it through your skin and you're breathing it out. 2. Your scale isn't that precise. It's going to vary by a certain amount because you're standing differently, the temperature changed, etc. 3. You're burning fats and sugars and part of your metabolism. Those are turning into CO2 and water, and the CO2 is being breathed out. 4. You're shedding skin flakes constantly to feed your pet dust mites in your mattress. This is probably not even worth mentioning in terms of weight loss, but it's a fun image.:) The mites must feed! Edit: Wait. scratch #3.

        "why you never hear about the human heart getting cancer, are there other organs that don\u2019t get cancer? The heart muscle itself, not so much. It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right atrium of the heart. You can also develop chemodectomas (tumors",

I think the question is why doesn't it get pulled out of us? That is because the rest of our bodies are putting more force holding it in place. Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong. I know some people will say the Iron in your blood isn't magnetic, but the interesting thing is that MRIs make things magnetic because an MRI is two magnets. One makes everything in your body more like a magnet. The other is to change the way they sit",
        "how come after all these thousands of years. Female to male ratio appears to stay a consistent 50/50 ratio? This is called Fisher's principle. Basically in species that reproduce like humans, the sex ratio automatically go to a 50/50 split. The thinking is if anyone in the species had a mutation that would result in more offspring of one gender, that would make the other gender have a greater chances of finding a mate and make having children of that gender preferable to pass on your genese. Whenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender. So like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle. That said 50/50 is not the real ratio in humans. It is just the approximate ratio of humans during their main reproductive years. Humans actually are born with slightly more",
        "Why do humans have to \"learn\" to swim? I don't think this is very true. Dogs, cats, and a lot of other land animals are able to swim. Most of them suck at it compared to animals that live in the water. Humans don't have an \"optional swimming feature\". We instinctively know how to do a very laborious paddle. When people \"learn to swim\" it has to do with training them to be better at it. For example, the body is (usually) naturally buoyant, but if you position yourself certain ways in water you still sink. So you learn things like how to float on your back or how to do a backstroke, which is extremely low-energy. Then you learn specific strokes that help you move faster or use less energy. But a completely untrained person is pretty likely to exhaust themselves and drown in a very short time, mostly because",
        "If your leg gets amputated, how does your body know to not produce enough blood to replace what was lost? The answers so far are crappy. Yes the kidneys regulate blood pressure, and if that drops due to losing blood, they will simply stop producing urine to keep all the water inside the body and dilute the remaining blood to keep the pressure up, so it still goes places. But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin (called epo when talking about doping in sports). They produce more of there\u2019s less oxygen in the bloood. Which happens when the blood is diluted, because you lost blood, and it wS simply filled back up with water. This hormone goes to the bone marrow and causes it to produce more red blood",
        "why do humans require so many types of food to be healthy when many animals can eat one thing? Humans (and all other things) evolved to minimize their need for THEIR most scarce resource. If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy. A mutation that makes use lose the ability to make vitamin C means we no longer waste that energy. If starvation is more likely to kill us than the lack of vitamin C, shedding that ability is advantageous. Other animals without thumbs were probably not",
        "How do babies learn a language when they are not taught it in a structured manner? These answers may be correct, but they do not have much linguistic basis. Babies are born with systems that help them learn language. One of these is Universal Grammar. Universal Grammar is the idea that all languages share the same grammar basics, and everyone (apart from those with extreme language disabilities) is born knowing those basics. This is a widely accepted theory from the famous linguist Noam Chomsky. However, the system has to be \u201cpowered on\u201d. Babies need exposure to language in order to actually develop language. They \u201cknow\u201d the basics, and, in their early years, babies are immersed in one or more languages. This way they learn vocabulary, and they \u201ctweak\u201d the Universal Grammar concepts they know to the languages they hear around them. Parents correcting mistakes doesn\u2019t really mean anything. There have been studies done that show that young children don\u2019t really benefit much from corrections. There is a theory called the \u201clack of stimulus",
        "Dinosaurs were around for 150m years. Why didn\u2019t they become more intelligent? Evolution doesn't have a goal. It doesn't really have a direction, or desired outcomes. Step by step, generation by generation, it runs through the simple process of \"is this genetic combination more likely to become common in the population than another genetic combination?\" If so, it becomes more common, and you get a shift in the population. If not, it doesn't. Probably. This all has a random element to it, and there are all sorts of factors involved. In the case of dinosaurs, it is tricky to know how smart they got, but some may have been as smart as modern big cats. Some modern dinosaurs (birds) can be pretty smart as well. But as for them not getting as intelligent as humans or dolphins, they didn't need",
        "why do babies sit with perfect posture when they learn to sit, but the older you get, the worse it gets? It\u2019s actually because of 2 reasons. They are also kind of interlinked. - firstly babies have very large heads (relatively) and they have a straight spine (that gets bent in and out as we age - which is normal). Having a large and heavy head and a weak neck will make it very hard to hold the head anywhere other than straight over the rest of the body. You can try wearing a heavy helmet and you\u2019ll see that slouching to look at your phone becomes extremely difficult. - this brings us to the second reason. That is modern society habits.

The thing is, humans are actually pretty hard to infect. We are covered in an ablative layer of keratine that is constantly growing and sluffing off. We have only a few openings in that later to the outside world, and they all have defenses to keep stuff out. This is necessary because the outside world would love to kill you.

        "how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of the fluid.

        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. Before germ theory, people believed in Humorism or the four humors. They were yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit. To anyone who finds this interesting: there\u2019s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels. When it separates, you see the dark clots at the bottom (black bile), the red blood",

You also have to remember that the ISS is a flying research laboratory where they often do biological and medical research.

You can reflect on things that just happened and analyse the past to learn and grow, and also can comprehend that a future exists and begin to understand how it could pan out. It alters your perception of literally the tiniest experiences, and I mean not just knowing language, but people who speak different languages think differently because of the way their brain processes information.

        "When someone gets pregnant while on birth control and then continues taking it daily until realizing they are pregnant, how does this not harm the fetus? Are there notable side effects from this? Birth control are synthetic *Progestins* AKA Progestogens that trick the body into thinking it's already pregnant. Normally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. Progestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it. It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. Progestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant. The point of this is essentially push pause on the normal ovulation cycle while the fetus is developing, so you don't end up with a second, concurrent fetus several months later. That would mean labor would not only certainly be fatal to the second",

These are animals like corals and barnacles. Why are they there in the ocean, but not on land? Well, it's because of how they live and what they need to survive. In the ocean, water moves around a lot, bringing food to these \"rock\" animals. They can just stay in one place and grab food as it floats by.

Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer. However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure. The narrowing can also affect the electrical activity causing the heart to become more prone to arrhythmia. If a coronary",

Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed. If it's too \"quiet\", not enough of the food to taste, or it's bland, we may not taste something if it never reaches the threshold. So what does this have to do with salt?

The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet",

We can only say what seems currently likely. Relatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that \"established\" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean. \"Regression to the mean\", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better.

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed.

The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet) for at least 3 minutes. We also avoid flying for at least 24 hours after a dive has ended as",

As an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger",

        "Why covering extremities in our bodies (especially our **feet for example, by wearing socks**) is so essential to warm our bodies. This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards. Scientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with multiple layers of clothing, insulating it well.

It would be more apt to say that sinuses protect the lungs indirectly though mucus, if one's pushing that point across. Second, going by the logic that sinuses trap harmful substances/organisms, one might come to a conclusion that we'd better off without having sinuses at all\u2014solely because of the existence of various types of cancer affecting that part of the body. So, in my opinion, the actual answer should go like so: 1. Sinuses produce mucus,'aiding' the immune system. 2.

The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work. The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work.

In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you\u2019re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good.

Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white.

Those receptors help your brain and body know you\u2019re tired. When you block them with caffeine, you just feel more awake while the caffeine is working. Cocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors. So you get a build up of dopamine in the synapse and it amplifies the effects of the dopamine. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so addictive- you\u2019re getting like huge hits of dopamine (which is a natural brain chemical) but in a super unnatural way. So while yes they are both stimulants- they work differently. Caffeine does interact with the dopamine brain chemicals and pathways, but",

Humans didn\u2019t evolve to have a litter or two a year and raise their young to be fully independent in a few months. We evolved to have just a few babies over our whole life. Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. This is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains. They need to be born kind of underdeveloped for survival because otherwise their heads would be so big that it would be too dangerous for the mother to give birth to them. Because babies are born not fully developed, instead of having lots of instincts already set up in their brains, they",
        "about boiling water for births It is very much a thing that is/was helpful for a short period of time -- when home births predominated but were attended by medical professionals who knew about sterilizing equipment, which you can see in the UK in the early seasons of Call the Midwife. They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment might possibly be a) known and b) useful. Otherwise it's a trope used",

Similarly, it bothers me when people require a purpose for a specific animal or species to exist. We can assign a benefit to the ecosystem. But it's usually arbitrary. Things just be. And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed. If you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier.

        "How does an alcohol overdose kill you? Hi there. simply put, you have two chemicals that either speed your brain and body up, or slow them down. GABA slows it down, glutamate speeds it up. They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't stop, which will eventually make you stop breathing because the muscles can't",

You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk.

If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise. But, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still (making you cold/weak/tired) - it might do both, but the homeostasis process is just trying to guard your energy stores. If the food is convincingly unavailable, burning fat to make you function will eventually happen",

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole.

Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva.

        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain. Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got. Humans have larger brains than other primates, and a similar neuron density, so we've got a lot of neurons AND a lot of brains. Minke whales have a brain that's 2.7 kg, compared to the humans",

One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel.

If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones. An episodic memory is basically \"this specific thing happened\". You do however form associative memories. These are more general and are the type that go: \"If I cry, caregiver will give me attention\", \"cat hurts\", \"shape goes into the square hole\".

There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it.

Due to their mostly water based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water",

Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral accumulation on the surface, it's usually lymph nodes swelling in response to chemicals released by the infection as your body takes action to fight the infection. - if it does kill anything it will be surface level membranes and cells. - the alcohol needs to be pretty strong and it still needs time to take effect. - just about anything can kill bacteria and viruses pretty easily.... When it's not in your body. You can kill cancer cells in a petri dish with a gun, to narrate the xkcd comic. The problem is that you want the patient to survive.

        "- Why is it so easy to overwater a plant, but sticking the roots directly underwater is how you propagate it? As long as the roots have oxygen, they will survive. This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering. If your plants live in a well drained sand/silt/clay mixture, you can water as much as you want and the plant will never ever rot. Water has oxygen in it",

An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. Women's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a",
        "how can insects survive a slap from humans, a creature that's gigantic compared to them A matter of scale. Resistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section. The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*. But area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry. Imagine an ant being the size of an elephant. All its dimensions would be roughly multiplied by something like 500, the strength of its legs by 500^2 = 250,000 but its weight by 500^3 = 125,000,000\u2026 and the poor beast would break down under its own weight.

Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to take place.

That means if you can keep it calm, it will be a big softy, and if you fall off one or spook it, it will try to run away. Since horses like to run away from things, we can put them on a very long leash or in a large, round playpen, and just let them run around while we are nearby until they say \"okay, people aren't that bad.\" Zebras on the other hand grew up with lions and crocodiles and other fast-attack ambush hunters.

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, compared to other developed countries, has a substantially higher infant mortality rate. This is a meta study, so looked accross methodologies of many different studies, and while the exact number (obviously) varied, the result was the same - looking at IMR, we are on par with Croatia, not the UK, Canada or Australia.

        "Why do some medications say to not consume grapefruit while taking them? Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful molecules, for example, converting",

Meandering rivers changing course, leaving ox-bow lakes. * 3). Weather. Floods covering lowlands, reaching lakes and receding again. (Or the very rare, but real, \"rain of fish\"!) * 4). Humans. Deliberate or accidental stocking of lake. * 5). Birds. Ever popular, but very badly researched area (at least a few years ago, when I tried to review the topic). A few different scenarios: * 5a).

Tar is a confusing one, because the \"tar\" they are referring to is not the same as the \"tar\" you may be thinking of, its not the same stuff they put on roads and roofs.

In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container. Incidentally this effect is also behind why when the city water supply has been shut off for a while, then turned back on, the water always comes out of your faucet a bit discolored (yellow or brown) until you let it run for a while.

Professional athletes can be quite stingy with how they use their bodies, and many running records were set by people who figured this out first. Notably Roger Bannister's four minute mile was run on [five hours of training per week](https://runningmagazine.ca/the-scene/the-surprisingly-simple-training-of-the-worlds-first-sub-4-minute-miler/) in 1954.

Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage. Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth.

Often like 2/3 the amount of carbs of normal sugar candy so those candies arent safe either.

In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators.

Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first.

        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose. Notice how this system doesn't leave any room for simple excretion of the excess. To add",

It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body. CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to remove a genetic disease (sickle-cell anemia) from patients, using a custom-designed one-time serum that the doctors injected into the patient.

It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it.

        "How do apes like chimps and gorillas have extraordinary strength, and are well muscled all year round - while humans need to constantly train and diet to achieve these same levels of fitness and strength?\nNew science shows us why apes are different in these ways: While our muscles change constantly according to the type of exercise that they do, their muscles stay strong, even when they are not engaging in exercise. This is what we must learn or regain in order to maintain our physical fitness as we age. So to maintain physical fitness as we age, we need to regularly engage in strength training to prevent muscle deterioration.\nRead on to find out more about why ape muscle strength differs from human muscle strength and then take the steps towards stronger, more well-toned muscles even if you haven't done strength training before.

Whereas a younger body's systems are at work 16 hours a day, the elderly are active 6 to 7 hours a day. Therefore the body slows down and one may become aware of the need to use stronger deodorants.\nAlthough there is considerable research ongoing by pharmaceutical companies who do not like to publicize that they are working on it and when an aging body starts to age even more than it already is they may be able to find a cure.\nThere is an array of different things that the elderly body odor could stem from. These include, but not are not limited to, the following:\n- A decrease in hormone levels can lead to aging and a decrease of sweating in certain places.\n- It can lead to a decrease of appetite.

Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time that good health depends on the healthy balance and harmony of the four humours or body fluids. The theory states that the body fluids are regulated and kept in order through a process called circulation and that anything that prevented this circulation caused disease.\n- To be healthy, all body fluids had to be in balance.\n- If any fluid was not in balance, it caused disease.\n- Bloodletting was thought to correct imbalances in the body fluids.

Salt can be described as an enhancer. The enhancement that salt makes is a flavor that is not normally present. The best, and most likely, reason behind this is that we are unable to detect its flavors until we become accustomed to it.\nIt is believed that humans were originally unable to taste anything bitter until it became more palatable. This is the reason why sweet and salty foods tend to taste better to us. As humans continue to eat and develop into different cultures, they develop their own flavors and foods.

By doing that, our heart and circulatory system need to work to maintain our core temperature and not waste precious blood and energy for our fingers and toes. Just so you have some idea of the complexity of the human body system, our brain is the master coordinator of all parts and organs. The brain regulates what we eat, drink or inhale.

First, the rate of air flow though the maxillary sinuses will have little if any effect on pressure in the brain or on any other system in the head. The primary reason for sinus pressure is the buildup of mucous secretions within the sinuses. Any interruption of mucous flow results in that feeling of nasal congestion, and this can be temporarily relieved by use of sprays or rinses that clean the nose and reduce the mucous discharge. When the blockage is a persistent or recurrent problem, often the most effective treatment is surgery to break the affected sinus open and clean out all the obstruction. A large number of studies have shown that sinus surgery can result in long lasting relief from the constant pressure and discharge which is very annoying. The sinuses do serve several other roles and these are not addressed by most of the ELI5 type answers. They are in fact the site of most of",

The heart pumps the venous blood up the veins. These veins are large enough to allow large volume of blood to flow up, which increases the pressure.

        "Why did humans get stuck with periods while other mammals didn't? It\u2019s because we are always fertile, instead of coming into heat a few days a year. That means that sometimes there is a small window when we are potentially fertile (called \"ovulation\"). The eggs have to be waiting for the sperm to fertilize them, and if they aren\u2019t fertilized, the lining of the uterus sheds itself and comes out of your body in your period. The cycle of menstruation and ovulation begins at age 14. Some people have the idea that menstruation begins at age 13 or 15, but if a woman has her first period when she is 13, then she would still not have ovulated. The first cycle after becoming sexually mature is called menarche. By the time a woman reaches menstruation, she will have had her first period 12 to 16 months before. Each period usually lasts for a few days. The menstrual cycle can",

The alcohol is an inebriant, a substance used to alter your mood or behavior; an intoxicating agent. It may be used to reduce stress, induce excitement, change your state of mind, relax your muscles, or depress your central nervous system. A drug is anything that affects the body or its functions. Alcohol may seem to have many of the same side effects as marijuana, but it does so at much higher concentrations in a much shorter period. The brain, nervous system and many other organs can suffer permanent damage after a single severe alcohol overdose. Alcohol overdose is defined as consuming a lethal amount of alcohol that causes death. Some of the symptoms include a blueish tint to the skin and fingernails (cyanosis), low blood pressure, lack of a gag reflex, seizures, and coma",

If you are feeling weak and tired due to skipping meals, you must surely realize one thing \u2013 your body cannot burn the stored fat. It is obvious that we need a lot of energy for various activities which can be gained from digesting the food which we consume. Our body can use the stored energy only when we regularly consume food which will then be used to maintain energy in the body which can be used at various phases of the day, by the body.\nThe body has been provided by nature with this ability to utilize the energy stored in its form for survival.

        "Why does blood sugar spike after a meal if food is digested in the stomach for several hours before it starts getting absorbed in the small intestine? Great question!\nYour blood sugar levels tend to increase after meals because hormones released in response to the meal signal to the liver to release stored glucose from the glycogen stores in the liver and to increase the rate at which glucose is entering the bloodstream. This process goes on for two hours, and it is what makes your blood sugar levels high after a meal.\nYour digestion speed can vary. When a meal that contains a lot of carbs hits your stomach, it takes several hours for the stomach to empty. Meanwhile, your blood reaches the small intestine in 30 minutes.\nYour blood sugar can rise and fall depending on the speed at which your stomach empties. It doesn\u2019t always happen that your blood sugar spikes immediately after a meal, depending on how many carbs are in the meal, and how quickly your stomach empties.\nThe amount",

The virus has been shown to be present in the blood of HIV infected persons who are on highly active antiretroviral treatment, but those patients can have undetectable HIV RNA levels.\nThe more recent literature would argue that there are a few differences between a person on HAART and a person whose viral load is undetectable, however these differences are relatively small. A low viral load is very much associated with the success of HAART. Persons with undetectable viral load as reported from the study have reduced incidence of new",
        "how do the gills of a fish actually extract oxygen and why can\u2019t they breathe oxygen from the atmosphere? Molecular oxygen is only relatively stable. If fish were to breath it, their bodies would break it down into oxygen ions. Some of the oxygen would be turned into water, and the process would ultimately remove oxygen ions from the body. Therefore, it\u2019s not possible for a fish to breathe freely and get the same amount of oxygen as it would from the water.\nHow do fishes get oxygen from water\nThe fish obtains oxygen through water in the gills. It does so by passing water through the gills, creating water currents. The water in the gills becomes saturated with oxygen as it passes through them. It also absorbs oxygen from the gas exchange organ.\nHow do fishes get oxygen from water in hot and cold water fish?\nFish have lungs\nFishes have an air bladder, similar to humans.

While the myoglobin is easily cleared from the body through the kidneys, the inflammation and irritation persists until the inflammation dies down.

A female has only one egg - that's it. While there are other resources (ovulation) to make more eggs, a male has multiple resources to make millions of sperm every day.

It is probably safe to assume that every dead virus particle eventually becomes non-viable, but if you want to be sure, there are procedures to accomplish this.\nIn general there are four classes of inactivators: heat, chemicals, radiation, and viruses. Heat and chemicals inactivate the virus immediately, but radiation kills them at a much slower rate. Radiation is probably the best and most cost-effective method.

I thought I was going to pass out, but I got her washed before I passed out.\nI can think of a dozen times that my grandfather had to be dragged out of bed to get to the bathroom. This was in the last year of his life, after",
        "the process that drives a typical spider Jeff is big and sedentary? Sounds like Jeff is a girl. Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own web. 2. How many eggs can a female spider lay at any one time? This means that during winter, spiders may go months between meals. Their young are usually larger versions of the female and will often help her find and capture their prey. Spiders come in a variety of colours, and can sometimes come together to form colonies; however, there is no link between the colour and size of a spider and their level of danger. 2. 6. The first segment of the abdomen is called the cephalothorax. They can be found on almost every continent. Why does the female spider spin its web in the shape of a wheel rather than the more famous ball? A bite is unlikely to have any lasting effects on a human, it simply causes a small amount of pain and redness for a few hours, swelling",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why weight is lost, so that there will be more progress, it is essential to know what causes fat deposits in the body on and what can be done to reduce them. This understanding is essential for a lasting weight loss that can be sustained without a lot of effort. A more complete understanding of weight and fat loss will also be needed to address the increasing epidemic of obesity in America and other developed countries.\nOne of the first problems that I see in overweight people is that most of them live too much. They tend to sit for most of the time. In this time in excess fat deposited.\nThe body is made to move, as we see in children who have difficulty sitting or standing during the first month of life. Over time they move more and start to eat more because they tire. After that, they tend to become less active and store",
        "Why can they treat HIV so effectively but not Cure it? I've apparently missed the party -- but an HIV cure will almost certainly be feasible before I die, but there is no cure as we speak. I don't buy the argument that we can't cure it in the face of progress in managing it. HIV itself didn't make us do this, we did it to ourselves.\nTo all the people who want to have this discussion in depth, you are in luck. This post was originally written at my blog, and after a bunch of comments and debate I went over and expounded a bit on this.\nHere's my thesis:\n1. HIV is a virus, and can't be a disease in the same way as the flu or tuberculosis\n2. Treatment can be more important than cure in the beginning as people wait to get the disease into remission, and that it may not always be obvious in advanced states of the disease how the body",
        "is it actually a lot worse to mouth breathe and why is it so bad? I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK airways that often, like right now, won\u2019t allow me to breath through my nose unless I\u2019m completely reclined or tilting to the right.\nThe air I inhale only moves through my mouth and I feel like it\u2019s a bit easier than breathing deeply through my nose, where I can get dizzy and sick, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not also mouth breathing.\nI also take a lot of antihistamines and the last time I checked with an allergist, most of them were pretty high on the list of things that are not good for you.\nWhy is this so bad?\nIs it actually a lot worse to mouth breathe and why is it so bad?\nWhy is mouth breathing so bad? Because it\u2019s not physiologically the way God set up a nose and mouth. They\u2019re",
        "Why are shoes made so narrow to the point that it changes the bone structure of our foot? There had to be a benefit at some point so make me a believer! What's so wrong with having a flat heel. Why do our feet have to be pointed?\nThanks.\nI have noticed that the running shoes that are on the market now are all about the same shape. However they all have arch support in them. When I was a kid in the 70's we did not have any arch support on our running shoes. And I went by a runner last year at the Cleveland Marathon, and they told me that this was their very first marathon. However, they wore a Brooks Adrenaline shoe that the shoe company had put an arch support into it so that he would not get heel pain. My question is has anyone ever heard of that type of thing happening before, or is the industry now putting arch supports, instead of flat feet into their shoes to prevent injuries.",
        "How/why does alcohol age a person's appearance? >It's full of histamines, which triggers massive inflammation. This starts temporarily, but after the first few beers you'll get massive inflammation in the brain, which can lead to Alzheimer-like symptoms later in life.\n- Is it bad for an adult to drink 5 beers everyday? >Yes it is not good for you. I have read that the human body is good to detox from alcohol at least two days of heavy drinking as the toxic levels of alcohol are very high. It has been known to cause death with such heavy alcohol intake. It is difficult to know what the exact amount will cause death but I think if you had a whole barrel in one sitting (not a whole pint glass in one sitting) this could kill you.\n- What does alcohol consumption do to your looks - why does it age people prematurely? >Alcohol causes inflammation, which in turn activates your skin's"
