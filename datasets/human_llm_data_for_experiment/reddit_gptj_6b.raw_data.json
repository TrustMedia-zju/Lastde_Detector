It's also rated at 100 calories (for the sake of this example), but unlike the apple, it doesn't have any of the extra vitamins, minerals, etc. Instead it is jam packed with filler - carbohydrates and fats. So for the same 100 calories, I can choose between the apple, which for that 100 calories, my body gets some carbs, some sugars, and then minerals and vitamins it can use for growth and repair. In other words, this 100 calories is well balanced with a multitude of things your body can use. Whereas the sticky bun is all carbs and fat. Your body cannot use any of that for long term growth or repair. All it can do is try to burn the carbs and store the fat. So, we say \"empty calories\" because in the case of the sticky bun, you",

Of the five main types of Asbestos fiber, the most commonly used type is Crysotile. The main hazardous characteristic of it is that when it becomes *fryable* the fibers tend to break into shards that have a weird physical structure that results in the ends of the fragments to have curled, hook-like ends that resemble microscopic velcro. The hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively. This results in the particles remaining in the body for MUCH longer, and that causes a body to resort to other means of self-preservation, such as encapsulation. When the body encapsulates an asbestos fiber,",
        "how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of the fluid. Here's are some non-ELI5 links: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081237 https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/fluid-dynamics/a/what-is-bernoullis-equation People wear them while flying on",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual",

Given the 5% body weight you say is necessary to occlude a skin capillary (at what blood pressure, by the way, since blood pressure would have a large impact on that), it seems unlikely that simple shifts in stance (eg swaying) would be significant enough to reduce occlusion pressure below critical opening pressure of the capillaries. So why don't the tissues of the sole of the feet become rapidly damaged in people who stand all day? 15 minutes of ischemia is enough to cause cell death, so people who spend hours standing in one place (such as grocery store clerks) should be experiencing numerous lesions on the sole of their foot, no?",
        "If your leg gets amputated, how does your body know to not produce enough blood to replace what was lost? The answers so far are crappy. Yes the kidneys regulate blood pressure, and if that drops due to losing blood, they will simply stop producing urine to keep all the water inside the body and dilute the remaining blood to keep the pressure up, so it still goes places. But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin (called epo when talking about doping in sports). They produce more of there\u2019s less oxygen in the bloood.

I mean, certainly there is an element of metabolism but a lot of fat middle aged people get there because of the financial change. They go from ramen and sparse finances justifying fewer meals to having more money and eating more in a sitting because their control was dictated by their wallet and not their constitution and habits. I also think elderly people tend to be at a point where they made the mistake and slimmed back down. Also more free time usually means more physical activity. I don't think its physical as much as a matter of societal factors...not to mention sample bias as you'd only see fit elderly people out.

First, the way that probiotics support your health does not require colonization. In the past it was believed that you would take probiotics and those would \u201cgrow\u201d inside your GI tract and that was it. Although we still have a lot to learn, we now know that most probiotics (if not all) don\u2019t actually colonize (remain) your body. They only remain there for as long as you take them. In medical school we don\u2019t really learn that much about probiotics and a lot of research is fairly new so a lot of doctors just now basic information on them.

        "Is it possible to see what ethnicity/race someone is just by looking at organs. For starters, race and ethnicity are social constructs. They are arbitrary lines drawn around perceived differences that have been reinforced via social structures. There is little to no genetic, physiological, or physical differentiation between different ethnicities or races that does not partially rely also on social classifications. Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\". Second, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone. The belief that the race of an individual can be determined through physiological clues is called **scientific racism**, **racialism**, or **race realism**. There are",

Calculators usually overestimate your protein goal a fair bit though, so it\u2019s up to you to decide on your own a bit. You probably do not need that much, but that being said it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t benefit from that much if not more. If you are working out hard, in more bodybuilding style workouts looking to gain as much muscle mass possible, this isn\u2019t an unreasonable amount of protein. Or if you\u2019re in a calorie deficit looking to shed fat to reveal as much muscle after a bulk it still is reasonable, as higher protein diets help against losing muscle in a calorie deficit.

It would be more apt to say that sinuses protect the lungs indirectly though mucus, if one's pushing that point across.

        "why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses? Wild horses who can't cope without them die:) But the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra",
        "Why do humans have to \"learn\" to swim? I don't think this is very true. Dogs, cats, and a lot of other land animals are able to swim. Most of them suck at it compared to animals that live in the water. Humans don't have an \"optional swimming feature\". We instinctively know how to do a very laborious paddle. When people \"learn to swim\" it has to do with training them to be better at it. For example, the body is (usually) naturally buoyant, but if you position yourself certain ways in water you still sink. So you learn things like how to float on your back or how to do a backstroke, which is extremely low-energy. Then you learn specific strokes that help you move faster or use less energy.

It is the squad keying method of modern combat. Modern combat keeps the keying of the person within one key and for all combatants the designation of the friendly is the key of C and associated and the enemy to be determined lurks outside of C. The egress point from C to the enemy in B is the resolvation G from a one or two bar of C. The common way to do this yields that people are fatter and taller especially, as the method yields octave resolvation which ultimately expand the keying of the person on a time basis towards being quite tall and weighty towards the end of the phase, and especially smaller at the beginning of the phase as the method starts with a single squad",

We have only a few openings in that later to the outside world, and they all have defenses to keep stuff out. This is necessary because the outside world would love to kill you.

We can only say what seems currently likely. Relatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that \"established\" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean. \"Regression to the mean\", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better. Even if they have a disease that is permanent and the body can't fix it, people have ups and downs within that context; and they tend to be going to get treatment when they're in the \"downs\".

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it\u2019s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don\u2019t the bladder will push against a close valve, and this pressure will rise and can damage the seals leading to a leaky bladder later in life.",

But if you drink lots of water the day after, you can flush out all that extra salt and now your fingers aren\u2019t swollen and you can remove your rings easily again. Our bodies typically maintain an important balance between how much salt/water circulates on its own, and literally flooding the system with either one will have side effects ranging from minor like swollen fingers to fatal.

Whenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender. So like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle.

How much longer could that person theoretically survive as compared to an average one? You need the vitamins and minerals that get lost through metabolism and urine. Additionally amino acids cannot be fully recycled so you would need to add those as well, or the body will take apart muscle including the heart muscle to obtain those amino acids (protein = multiple amino acids). If those 3 points are met, then yes the obese person would only starve once their fat storage runs out. Depending on degree of obesity, this will take over a year.

In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination).

        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet) for at least 3",

(called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas",

This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering.

        "when we improve our cardio, what is it that actually changes within our body for us to be able go from running our first mile to say a marathon? Your body can generate energy to fuel your muscles in different ways. At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy. This chemical that glycogen combines with is called lactate and it's the reason why your muscles start to burn when you start working out",
        "Why do cheeses get aged for years but 1 week in a fridge and it gets moldy? Precisely that. France here. As it happens, several of my friends run high-end cheese shops in Paris and I've had the chance to visit their installations and ask questions over the years, and OP's question was one of the first ones I though of, as it's a natural one. Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference. This is why you can take a non-mature goat cheese,",

        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic.

And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed. If you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier. But as humans we hate loss so we see a species that existed, being killed off as damaging. To take it even a step further, when people complain that humans are evil because they damage the environment. No, we change it.

There are multiple factors involved in this, but it comes down to neurotransmitter deficits, particularly your GABA system, and something called glutamate rebound. Searching for alcohol, gaba, and glutamate on YouTube will probably find a better video than I could explain. In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you\u2019re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good. Over time, the problem is that the body stops producing that which it is having supplemented, so, if your neurotransmitters were",
        "why you never hear about the human heart getting cancer, are there other organs that don\u2019t get cancer? The heart muscle itself, not so much. It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right atrium of the heart. You can also develop chemodectomas (tumors of special sensory cells) in the aortic body (which",

Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer. However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure. The narrowing can also affect the electrical activity causing the heart to become more prone to arrhythmia. If a coronary artery",

You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. Secondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%). Nearly all SIDS cases present with at least one of the above risk factors, excluding bed-sharing. Additionally, groups get conflated - babies",

        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain. Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got.

I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander.

The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color.

They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content.

        "Why are Animals able to gorge themselves with days worth of food, but Humans can't. The notion of \"apex\" predator\" is flawed in a lot of scenarios regarding animals. Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators. This rarely happens because rarely there is an animal that is able to localize and identify such vulnerable individuals to exploit and do opportunistic predation, as well as the risk of injuries. When an animal have higher sociality and engages in more complex cooperative hunting, the ability to handle the stress of large meals is unneeded",
        "the process that drives a typical spider Jeff is big and sedentary? Sounds like Jeff is a girl. Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with. A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during. Spiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses. Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first. That's not to say spiders can't learn, or that they are all the same. Spiders",

        "Why do men have bigger feet in contrast to women? Why aren't their average foot sizes equal? An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. Women's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a shorter gait and wider hips. This contributes to more efficient walking, standing, and less wear and effort expended on joints and muscles in the",
        "about boiling water for births It is very much a thing that is/was helpful for a short period of time -- when home births predominated but were attended by medical professionals who knew about sterilizing equipment, which you can see in the UK in the early seasons of Call the Midwife. They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment might possibly be a) known and b) useful. Otherwise it's a trope used for humor,",

Say a kid weighs 25 kg, and an adult weighs 100. * **To simply move your body the same distance**, the adult expends 4X more energy because they are moving 4X more mass. Now lets look at heat produced. The adult's 100 kg body is built and shaped proportional to the 25 kg kid. * Kids have a higher surface area / mass ratio. They lose heat faster than adults. This means that **kids burn more energy for producing heat.** Lets look at behaviour. Yesterday I sat at work for an extended time. Healthy kids probably moved around more than me.

        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They mention that episodic memories usually start around 3-4 years of age. Some people mentioned how memory is linked to language, but this isn't proven. If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones. An episodic memory is basically \"this specific thing happened\". You do however form associative memories. These are more general and are the type that go: \"If I cry, caregiver will give me attention\", \"cat hurts\", \"shape goes into the square hole\". It also includes language, and you could argue that language strengthens associative language. In this fase we learn what things",

Once the bone drops away the gum follows.

Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing. Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. Humans are specialized in... well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances.

        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning? Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to take place.

Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral accumulation on the surface, it's usually lymph nodes swelling in response to chemicals released by the infection as your body takes action to fight the infection. - if it does kill anything it will be surface level membranes and cells. - the alcohol needs to be pretty strong and it still needs time to take effect. - just about anything can kill bacteria and viruses pretty easily.... When it's not in your body. You can kill cancer cells in a petri dish with a gun, to narrate the xkcd comic. The problem is that you want the patient to survive.

The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*.

Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed.

Are there notable side effects from this? Birth control are synthetic *Progestins* AKA Progestogens that trick the body into thinking it's already pregnant. Normally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. Progestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it. It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. Progestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant.

If not, it doesn't. Probably. This all has a random element to it, and there are all sorts of factors involved. In the case of dinosaurs, it is tricky to know how smart they got, but some may have been as smart as modern big cats. Some modern dinosaurs (birds) can be pretty smart as well.

While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night.

Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration. In some unique cases you do have blues, but this is not pigment but structural",

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed. It passes through much quicker and everything in it will be absorbed much quicker. This can lead to a rapid rise of you blood glucose since nothing is slowing down the absorption.

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, compared to other developed countries, has a substantially higher infant mortality rate. This is a meta study, so looked accross methodologies of many different studies, and while the exact number (obviously) varied, the result was the same - looking at IMR, we are on par with Croatia, not the UK, Canada or Australia.

For instance, income disparity only accounts for 30% fo the gap in infant mortality compared to Finland. So, while that is a chunk of the explanation (we have great healthcare, but only if you are that has it AND can afford it). To be fair - I think this may have been obfuscated by some low income jobs having better insurance. One thing this paper didn't touch on was racial disparity in mortality rates.

        "When drinking water and it \u201cgoes down the wrong pipe\u201d is that water entering your airways? And if so, how does it go away? [This graphic](https://imgur.com/gallery/9KdKYPN) gives a detailed view of the inner workings of your throat. The trachea (gases) and esophagus (solids/liquids) are layered together. There are muscles and valves that close off to make sure liquid or solids don\u2019t enter the lungs while swallowing or vice versa air into the stomach while breathing. And why you shouldn\u2019t try to breathe in while drinking liquids (like drinking while heavy panting after exercise or thinking water will help while choking\u2026) When you either accidentally override the automatic muscle closures or are too incapacitated to close those muscles properly anymore you get what\u2019s called \u201caspiration\u201d.

Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva. You know that feeling of your mouth watering when you look at/smell something delicious? That's the first stage of digestion preparing itself for the work ahead. If you want to check saliva amylasis in action, try a piece of something you wouldn't consider sweet, but contains carbs",

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine",

        "why do humans require so many types of food to be healthy when many animals can eat one thing? Humans (and all other things) evolved to minimize their need for THEIR most scarce resource. If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy. A mutation that makes use lose the ability to make vitamin C means we no longer waste that energy. If starvation is more likely to kill us than the lack of vitamin C, shedding that ability is advantageous. Other animals without thumbs were probably not able",

It's better for those oxygen atoms than being by themselves, but they *really* want some extra electrons, and are basically fighting to gain possession of the other atom's. There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it. One big strong oxygen can take care of a single molecular hydrogen too. Its a pretty great set up for both of them. So when molecular hydrogen and oxygen get to hanging out, it tends to be pretty explosive. Molecular hydrogen, however, is pretty rare here on earth--its often tied up",

They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth.

In fact, in some places, the natural mineral water contains significantly *more* fluoride than is recommended to reduce tooth decay, and the excess is removed. Basically, the recommended levels of fluoridation are known to be generally beneficial, and are known not to be harmful, and are well within the bounds of what might be found in nature anyway, and the fluoride is cheap and fluoridation is easy. This is a pretty unusual confluence of factors. Why should we expect the same to be true of, say, Vitamin C? Most people get more than enough of that anyway and would not benefit at all from adding",

In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the brain. This is how all vertebrates know what's up and what's down. We",
        "Why covering extremities in our bodies (especially our **feet for example, by wearing socks**) is so essential to warm our bodies. This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards. Scientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with multiple layers of clothing,",
        "Why is duck meat red meat and can be consumed medium rare and chicken meat white meat which should be cooked thoroughly even though they're both birds? Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That\u2019s 165 \u00baF / 74 \u00baC. The appearance and texture will be different due to the difference in myoglobin and fat content. The higher fat content in duck meat makes it juicier and more moist compared to chicken. The higher myoglobin content will make it look more like what we associate with medium rare from steaks. The chance of chickens carrying food borne pathogens like Salmonella is"

For instance, if your finger was broken, in the typical case, you would not have the finger back on your hand until it had healed completely and no longer needed the support that the bandage was providing. On the other hand, since you have a bandaid on the broken finger, it does not go through the usual normal healing process, and the finger goes right back to what it would be like if it did not have the break (it looks and acts the same, so the scarring is the same, etc.).\n",

The baby is squeezed inside, the brain and spinal cord are compressed, and the head gets squeezed against the pelvic bones. It is not easy to squeeze water out of a stretched piece of rubber. The uterus is big so this is usually not the cause. It is all about pressure.\n\nHow do women die when giving birth?\n\nMost women die when giving birth, often because the baby\u2019s heart stops beating. This means there is no blood flow to the brain and spinal cord and that brain cells can not function properly.

When alcohol is burned or inhaled, it causes even more of these toxins. The process works this way, too: your body breaks the alcohol down into aldehydes, then those into aldehydes, then those into aldehydes, then those into aldehydes, etc. Your cells go crazy and begin to leak, the cells begin to leak, and more toxins are released; finally, the cells begin to leak, and more aldehydes are released, and more toxins. Eventually, when this process reaches the cells that make up the walls of blood vessels or that make up the lining of sinuses, it becomes chronic and can result in damage to these areas.</strong>\n\nAs a way to",

Whereas a younger person may lose 10-20 pounds a decade the older person may lose 25-50 pounds a decade. With age comes a slowing metabolism. That explains the general smelliness of the elderly (although it does not explain the stinkiness!) More specifically the metabolism of your body becomes more efficient leading to a greater metabolic rate. The old organs begin to break down and decompose. Your body also sheds a lot more sweat as it ages. This causes your sweat glands to kick into gear. You sweat and have smelly underarms, chest, etc. As your body breaks down more fats are present and these can smell. This process begins as soon as you hit 30. It is why my parents began to smell worse within two years of passing 40. It's normal.\nYou can use olive oil either externally or internally.\n\nExternal: Rub",

        "Why can't things be sterilized by time? Well, it depends on the pathogen in question. Most viral particles quickly become non-viable in a few hours at room temperature. Viruses like rabies, smallpox, flu and measles are completely destroyed in hours, and this can help prevent outbreaks from spreading in the first place.\n\nThe longer something takes - say, a minute - to be sterilized in a sterilizer, the longer it will stay around.\n\nA minute-long delay between each use increases the chance that the pathogen that remains will change enough to become infectious again. That said, it's not a huge problem with viruses, because it takes them only 12 to 16 hours to become detectable in the blood.

An important note is that in addition to height differences, there are several other causes as well. This includes physical abnormalities, hereditary variations and foot shape as well as footwear, health conditions and footwear choices.\n\nHeight as a Factor\n\nMen are typically heavier than women and generally have smaller feet. This may not seem very surprising since women typically have longer legs. However, because weight is distributed evenly on both feet, the heavier man should have larger feet. For example, if his leg length is 6' then that is the average size of his feet. A man with a 7'-10\" leg may have size 12 feet. However, that's not to say, that a woman could not have as many as men as her height.

While many researchers have said this same thing before, this is the first study of many now to truly break down the numbers to illustrate the effect of evolutionary force in nature: it is not simply genetic differences between the animals that lead to the extra muscle mass and endurance (which is the claim often used in popularized, but not well-informed animal",

        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning? Delayed onset muscle soreness, or DOMS, results from muscle contractions as it recovers from the work itself. You do not feel muscle soreness during or immediately after a workout because it is happening immediately after the injury has occurred. You likely feel the soreness at around the time you usually wake up because your body is making the transition from sleep to waking. Here is how it works:\n\nDuring exercise, muscle shortens by 20-50% from its resting length [1]; contraction shortens muscles by 50-100% [2]; and stretching elongates muscles by 50-99% [3]. During rest (while muscles are active), collagen is broken down and new collagen is made. The amount of new collagen made depends on how much stretching there was prior to exercise. The new collagen is not as elastic or firm as the existing fibers which",

Are there possible risks to the baby after birth?\n\nYou have a very small risk of passing some forms of birth control to the fetus. When they do this, they need to also take the pregnancy test to see if you are in fact pregnant. After this happens, the doctors will check you and if it is found that you're not already pregnant, they will remove from you the birth control they were using. This is done by breaking down the hormone that creates birth control.\n\nThe other issue you have is that their was always the question of if the fetus could possibly recognize the chemical.

        "Why is eating an orange better for your blood sugar than drinking orange juice? >when you eat an orange, doesn\u2019t it pretty much immediately break down into glucose in the same way that juice would? >\n\nYes, the fruit provides sugar energy that is metabolized immediately. But fruit also provides fiber, potassium, vitamin C and is high in many other nutrients. That is in addition to the fact that the soluble fiber contained in the cells of the orange provides a slow release of sugars that can be utilized over a period of time.\n\nWhen you eat a whole orange, the majority of it will be digested within the first 20 minutes or so. So you will likely have a significant increase in blood sugar, but that will last less than 10 or 20 minutes. The soluble fiber contained in the pulp will take up to 30-45 minutes to be metabolized and that will be followed by a release of glucose resulting in a lower rise in BGS. The fibers in the",

Your clothes act like a filter. Now, if there was a drop of blood on the inside of my finger, I would not expect to have blood seep into my clothes. Since my finger is in my skin, not under a shell, the blood is not filtered out to my blood. The blood is filtered to the outside (through your clothes).

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, contrary to most of Europe, has the 14th highest death rate in the world in terms of women giving birth to live babies, despite being #1 in GDP per capita. This was in 2003. This study from 2008 finds that maternal deaths doubled between 1999 and 2005. This study says that the number of US births is rising because fewer women are having babies. They found that the abortion rate is up. These statistics might seem shocking, but they don\u2019t shock me. I studied how the US spends over a half billion tax dollars to encourage contraception usage and I wrote this book, The Myth of the Rational Pregnancy Planner, which shows how birth control is promoted by companies that pay for advertising, which leads to low literacy about family planning.

If it was just regular brushing and flossing, teeth would be maintenance mode in all but the most extreme circumstances \u2014 and it's not just brushing and flossing that causes teeth to become resistant to normal brushing and flossing.

If your body gets used to not drinking any liquids at all, drinking a lot may cause problems. If you're constantly binge-drinking, you're more often hanging out at low-alcohol bars/restaurants, and the same effect would happen. Alcohol has a terrible effect on your body's internal clock. When you drink a large amount of strong alcohol, this is a shock to your body (no pun intended) and your brain is thrown off course, so that the next day is basically an absolute disaster.\n\nAlso, it's not just alcohol affecting the brain.

A GP is more into what ails you and why. A heart specialist is more than willing to test the condition of your heart. (You pay $250-500 for the whole shebang on your insurance.) They have access to some great machinery that will read your arteries and show what is in them to be sure. If the answer is bad, great. That leads us to the question about why they don\u2019t check regularly? If you show a doctor that you\u2019re overweight, the first thing they should do is measure your blood pressure or have a nurse take a blood pressure.

In fact, the only male contraceptive pill on the market is not designed for use by a single person, but by a couple and is only available as one of a limited set of emergency contraceptives.\n\nThat\u2019s changing now with the arrival of a new, injectable contraceptive pill for men.\n\nThe pill was designed by French biotech firm",
        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time and is still held by many people today\u2014that the cause of many diseases was \u201ccongestion,\u201d caused by the blood not flowing out of the body. The theory of medicine was that by emptying the blood by the use of the lancet to cut a vein or artery, the congestion would be relieved, leading to better health because of better blood flow. Thus, an individual could use bloodletting to treat disease. A common procedure would be to insert a sharp object into a vein and then press down on the body, creating a vein break, so that blood would rush out of the affected parts of the body, to be then drained from the body by the use of a funnel.\n\nWho did bloodletting? Why was it used in medicine? And why did \u201cscientific medicine\u201d abandon",
        "Why do we take medicine to suppress symptoms like coughing, fever, etc. when those are our bodies way of fighting infection? Internal medicine physician here.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nThat's a great question. Suppression of symptoms is more of a treatment/intervention to help maintain or regain a normal state of health. It does not always mean that the illness has been eradicated if it is suppressed.\n\nThe reason suppression of symptoms is used is because we don't get the necessary \"kill\" from our immune defenses. Suppression allows us to return quickly to more normal functioning, which is most often desired in disease treatments, etc. When there are no more pathogens to kill, suppression is not necessary. Of course, there are some things that we don't want to suppress as we don't want to have suppressed the body's natural way of dealing with illness. When these are the cases, we use treatment/intervention in some form.\n\nThe reason suppression of",

It\u2019s like trying to tell the same lie over and over again, and you know the truth is always coming and it will catch up to you at some point. It usually does.\n\nThere is no better time than now to start taking care of all the beautiful and important things you can never grow well indoors.\n\nA few days ago I took down a few sunflowers and repotted them into larger containers of soil. They were planted way too deep. I did not want to dig holes in my yard after already doing so, so I placed them in the back of the house so I could repot them in the spring with more care.\n\nA good repot with the wrong kind of soil can be as harmful as repotting with the right kind of soil in the wrong location. Your sunflowers may not grow",
        "Why can't we just spend however long it takes to brush our teeth over and over again until they're as clean and white as they were when we were little? Why make such a fuss and get so obsessed with an incredibly simple act? I understand that to some, teeth brushing isn't that important after all, but I'm just so proud that my teeth are as white and flawless as they are after doing this once a day and I don't want to stop.\n\nSunday, April 14, 2012\n\nI came across an interesting YouTube video the other night and I thought it was really interesting. The gist is that humans and bonobos (their closest relative) have very different brains and that, according to this scientist, the \"evolutionary answer\" to why we have brains so much larger than bonobos is to help us with socializing (hence the human-like intelligence and reasoning abilities).\n\nThis scientist made several assumptions that I was curious about, not the least",
        "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses? When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patrollers of the body; but viruses are specific and very well adapted to their hosts. So once the virus is detected, a very complex set of factors kick in: a first line of defence, the phagocytes (specialised cells), which engulf and destroy any virus/bacteria/other particles as they enter the body. Then the next layer, the other immune cells (a type of white blood cell, the macrophages) which, at this point they're not sure exactly what they're up against, but they also detect and recognise the virus. Once identified they will attempt to neutralise and destroy the invading particles. The second (and more important) layer is called the adaptive immune system. This system is a very complex system of immune cells that remember this virus and will then defend the body against a new encounter with that same virus.",
        "Eggs in the supermarket state on the box \u201cDouble Yolk\u201d. Without cracking them, how do they know\u2026.? > It\u2019s true. Double yolks and other \u2018food facts\u2019 can be tricky to work out. Here is simple scientific fact that explains why.\n\nYolks are high in vitamins A and D but it\u2019s not the cholesterol in eggs that is bad for you. It is the protein, a type of protein called Triglycerides and saturated fat found primarily in eggs, that can cause heart problems and contribute to weight gain.\n\nBut this is not good news for everyone. The fact is that not everyone is eating eggs with double yolks every day. And that may be the real reason your waistline is expanding.\n\nBut what are the best ways to check double yolk egg levels and other food facts? How can you be sure you are not eating a double yolk egg?",
        "Why have zebras never been utilized as cavalry animals? Eli5: Horses grew up with wolves and bears, which you can run away from if the bear gets too close or the wolf tries to tear you apart. A zebra, on the other hand, just stands there with his head down. Eli5: A zebra is no trouble at all. You can mount him and go right on your way.\n\nHorses grow up riding on trees, not on the ground. They don't run away from danger. Zebras will charge if you get too close to them! You will have to try something other than running away like a coward. You have no idea who is going to attack you at any moment!\n\nEli5: That's true. Zebras are slow moving animals. If they were used as cavalry, it would only take 1 person attacking to easily kill the entire zebra party. Eli5: That's no problem. What we need",
        "If both liver and kidneys are cleaning the blood, what's the difference between them? The liver's primary job is to make compounds in your blood take a different shape. The kidney's job is cleaning out the compounds you haven't made to take that shape.\n\nThe kidney-liver axis is very tightly connected, though. Both are influenced by what you eat, by the chemicals around you all day long, and by the stress of the day -- and, of course, by the genes you inherit.\n\nOne of the most important things the kidney does is keep potassium balanced. Too much potassium in the blood is almost always a bad sign: it can cause your heart to beat too fast or too slow, you can experience paralysis, coma, seizures, and even death.\n\nOur kidneys can usually manage potassium just fine, but it's important to maintain the proper balance -- particularly for women, who are more sensitive to too much potassium in their blood because they have a lot of",
        "Why is sodium fluoride added to the toothpaste when it's calcium fluoride that is actually helping the teeth? > Now why aren\u2019t we putting this product on the shelves? The FDA requires that toothpastes containing fluoride must pass specific safety and performance tests. They also need to satisfy the industry in that if the fluoride is used to its maximum level, it should provide greater than 400 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride for all consumers in areas where fluoridation is at its optimum level of 0.7 mg/g drinking water. The test results must show that the product in its optimal fluoride-level will have the same or higher level of fluoride when used for brushing. If the product achieves more than 400 ppm, it fails the tests. What if calcium fluoride is used in place of sodium fluoride? Because of the pH difference between toothpastes formulated with sodium fluoride and toothpastes formulated with calcium fluoride, they have a problem passing this test. According to the FDA's official",
        "why fish always orient themselves upright (with their backs to the sky, and belly to the ocean floor) while living in a 3d space-like world\u201d).\n\nIt is because they are not as smart or as advanced as us.

It\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nAlso\u2026the term \u201cevolutionary psychology\u201d is also misleading and/or inaccurate. Evolutionary psychology looks at the underlying nature of human behavior, but not necessarily human development (how we go from point A to point B) and how that differs for humans from other apes.\n\nIf you want more on this, I would recommend reading Steven Pinker\u2019s \u201cHow the Mind Works\u201d. It explains how our cognitive abilities differ greatly from chimps and are pretty unique among other animals.\n\nI am a huge proponent of",
        "Why covering extremities in our bodies (especially our **feet for example, by wearing socks**) is so essential to warm our bodies. This is even more valuable in the winter when you are wearing cold, wet shoes and wearing insulated **hiking boots and shoes**.\n\nThe feet are considered the _door to the soul_. In the same way if the doors to _the soul_ are not open to the world, we are no longer in _full-body contact_ with _the world_ and all that it has to offer and offers to us.

        "Why is duck meat red meat and can be consumed medium rare and chicken meat white meat which should be cooked thoroughly even though they're both birds? Ducks have feathers, they're more than likely to have fur, and they may have scales of some kind but we don't call chicken fur. So why is the chicken-white meat and the duck-meat-red meat?\n\nA:\n\nThis is probably what you asked in the beginning:\nWhy was the chicken-white meat called \"dark meat\"?\nIt doesn't have any significant melanin and thus its meat is generally paler than the chicken-dark meat (thigh and breast). The colouring in birds is caused by the pigment melanin, also found in humans. Its presence in the tissue determines its colour. \n\"Dark\" means it doesn't get this colouring, hence the name \"dark meat\". I think this is how the word came to be used in English.\n\n"
