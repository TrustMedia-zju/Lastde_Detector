        "Earlier, the space agency released the most detailed picture yet as it hurtled towards the dwarf planet on Tuesday. The probe was set to grab more images and other data as it passed just 12,500km from the little world at 11:50 GMT (12:50 BST). The spacecraft is currently out of contact with Earth as it continues its observations. But scientists already have colour data from the approach and said they might release another new picture of Pluto later on Tuesday. Images set to be released on Wednesday will be more than 10 times the resolution of those already published. New Horizons' flyby of 2,370km-wide Pluto is a key moment in the history of space exploration. It marks the fact that all nine objects considered by many to be the Solar System's planets - from Mercury through to Pluto - have now been visited at least once by a probe. \"We have completed the initial reconnaissance of the Solar System,",

Latest updates on this case and other London stories Twelve other people on the ground were also injured in the crash. Mr Barnes, a pilot of 24 years, was under great commercial pressure to satisfy an important client that morning when he made the flawed decision to fly, which was \"neither safe nor appropriate\", the inquest heard. He had been flying from Redhill Aerodrome in Surrey to Elstree in Hertfordshire but was diverted to Battersea heliport. The jury accepted the Air Accident Investigation Branch's evidence that Mr Barnes experienced a \"loss of situational awareness\" because of poor visibility, causing the accident.

Orders in the manufacturing sector are expanding at the fastest rate in 25 years. Consumers are acting \"almost as though the referendum had not taken place\" asserts Andy Haldane, the Chief Economist at the Bank of England.

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does",

It introduces \"opt out\" actions where everyone affected is automatically a member of the \"class\" which is suing. Consumer groups say it is a huge step forward in helping secure compensation. Previously, when groups of consumers or small and medium-sized businesses wanted to take action against companies who fixed the price of goods or services, on - for example - replica football shirts or air fares, it was very difficult. All of those affected had ether had to \"opt in\" to the action or bring a claim in their own name. As individual losses were small and legal costs and risks high, few did.

Householders are protected from prosecution as long as they act \"honestly and instinctively\" in the heat of the moment. \"Fine judgements\" over the level of force used are not expected, says the Crown Prosecution Service. What this means in practice is that someone can claim they attacked in self-defence if they genuinely believed they were in peril - even if in hindsight they were clearly wrong. Victims do not have to wait to be attacked if they are in their home and fear for themselves or others. These guidelines also apply if someone, in the spur of the moment, picks up an item to use as a weapon. The law very clearly says that a householder is not expected to weigh up the arguments for and against in the heat of the moment - but they have",

Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon.

About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production.

Eurozone interest rates have remained unchanged since November 2013, when the bank said it expected \"a prolonged period of low inflation\".

This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive.

We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed.

Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise.

        "The consumers - the voters - appear to be shrugging off the uncertainties, the unknowns and the warnings of future risks. Many economists had predicted that consumers would rein in spending and save more in anticipation of a severe slowdown. The result would have been a significant drag on economic growth. Instead, consumers have been spending at a rate well over three percent the size of the economy. This surge has continued through the end of 2007 and has played a major role in the strength of the economy in the first half of 2008.\n\nBut how long will the trend last? Why are consumers behaving this way? What will be the economic outcome? Answering these questions requires a close look at the fundamentals of household behavior today. The good news is that many of the fundamentals that drive consumer spending decisions, such as job availability, wage increases, housing wealth and credit availability, all remain generally strong, at least for now. The bad news is that many of these fundamentals will not",

        "The visitors went ahead when the Rams failed to deal with Marc Roberts' long throw and on-loan midfielder Matty James headed home. The lead lasted just six minutes.\n\nBut the Rams, with Lee Evans in a much more advanced position, equalised when he tapped in following Curtis Davies' shot.\n\nDerby went ahead in the 28th minute when Mason Holgate's mistake allowed Chris Martin to tap in for his first goal at St James Park.\n\nThe visitors were much the better side in the opening minutes of the second half and Derby substitute Will Hughes curled the ball past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford from just outside the area and into the top corner.\n\nThe Blues came into the game as the second half went on but could not pull a goal back although Jake Galloway's cross was headed against the crossbar by Chris O'Grady.\n\nThe loss means Burton slip to eighth in League One, one point behind Southend who have a game in hand, while Derby move",
        "At a campaign rally, he called the South Carolina senator an \"idiot\" and then told the crowd to try the number. A Politico reporter called it \"weirdly intimate.\"\n\nTrump, 64, who is running as a first-time candidate for the White House, was on stage last week in New Hampshire with his running mate, New Mexico governor Gary Johnson.\n\nBut after talking about how the nation should be a \"superpower\" and how to fight the Islamic State group, the president said he was going to hand out Senator McConnell's phone number to his supporters.\n\n\"He's done nothing, this idiot, but say: 'Vote Hillary, vote Hillary, vote Hillary.' And the polls are so tight,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He's a dummy, you've got to vote,\" Trump then told the crowd.\n\n\"You want to vote? Here's his number, Senator [Mitch] McConnell.\"\n\nTrump then told the crowd",
        "They have been on strike since 24 March in a dispute over cuts to pay and working conditions. Management has said the changes are essential to save the failing business.  But union leaders describe their proposals as a \"betrayal\" of loyal and long-serving employees.\n\nAlistair Budden, the Unite union\u2019s regional officer, said: \u201cThe strikes at Crown Lynn is a very serious and disturbing situation.  The business model put forward is based on cutting jobs and workers\u2019 rights to the bone.  All that will be left will be a skeleton workforce.\n\n\u201cWorkers have never had cause for concern about their employment security.  The changes will hit the most vulnerable workers, some being asked to work two days a week and to pick up the slack elsewhere.\n\n\u201cCrown Lynn is a company that has had over-employment for too long and cannot continue.  But why should loyal and long-serving employees be the scapegoats? This cannot be justified at any",
        "Rangers confirmed that Jardine had lost an 18-month battle against cancer on Thursday evening. He was part of their European Cup Winners' Cup winning team in 1972.\n\nScotland manager Craig Brown told BBC Sport: \"He was a great character and a true gentleman.\n\n\"His whole attitude as a player reflected his love of the game.\"\n\nJardine's brother-in-law Willie Henderson was one of Rangers' goalscorers in the historic 3-2 defeat of Dynamo Moscow in 1972.\n\n\"Rangers was my team, it always was, and it still is,\" Jardine told the BBC's Radio Scotland sports phone-in at the time.\n\n\"I remember Willie Henderson coming back and telling me about it and the hairs at the back of my neck just bristled,\" Jardine recalled.\n\nJardine, who also briefly played at Celtic - before and since his move to Ibrox - was described by",
        "A boost of A$29.9b ($21.4b, \u00c2\u00a315.4b) over the next decade will be used to make Canberra more 'liveable and sustainable', the government says.\n\nThe government's five-year forward rolling budget will be released next month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced.\n\nHe will launch the new forward budget estimates on Friday, which will be a key message for his government on the state of the economy.\n\n\"The forward estimates show that the economy is strong, that our budget is strong and it allows us to make strategic investments,\" he told ABC TV on Thursday.\n\nLast week's federal budget forecast record budget surpluses of $78.6 billion over the next four years, which will pave the way for $28.7 billion in new spending and tax relief over the same period.\n\nNew spending includes billions on housing, childcare, schools and the environment.\n\nMr Albanese said his",
        "The two sides meet in Saturday's World Cup Pool A match at Twickenham, kick-off 20:00 BST.\n\n\"It will be weird and slightly surreal on Saturday. It will be as if I am playing for Australia against England,\" said the 30-year-old.\n\n\"But it will definitely be good for me and my family and for Australian rugby.\"\n\nThe Melbourne-born winger, who has played more than 120 times for Leicester and was part of Tigers side that beat Northampton in the Premiership final at Twickenham last season, has fond memories of the ground. But he will not be able to get away with the usual Aussie tradition of wearing a pair of green and gold socks before playing England.\n\n\"I usually wear green and gold before playing England. For some reason it has been a tradition of mine I guess.\n\n\"But if I do, I will be the only Australian in the squad trying to do",
        "Connacht have become accustomed to beating Leinster and Munster in recent seasons but have only earned one win over Ulster in 20 attempts. That came at the RDS, the province in which Connacht's roots lie.\n\nThere they are unbeaten in five matches. And while Ulster have been competitive on most visits to the Sportsground, that remains the province in which they have fared worst.\n\nThey boast a 100 per cent home record, with seven wins, three of which have come over Ulster. Most of those games have been nip and tuck affairs as well and the scoreline for that win reads 25-23, not the typical lopsided figures.\n\nWith three points ahead of Ulster in the table, this one could have enormous significance for the visitors' hopes of finishing second and locking down that home quarter-final.\n\n<strong>Last meeting</strong>\n\nConnacht 15-16 Ulster in December last year was a strange affair with both teams losing all",
        "Families with one parent with a taxable income of more than \u00a350,000 will lose some of the benefit, and it will be removed at a rate of 1 per cent for every extra \u00a3250 earned above that threshold.\n\nThe maximum benefit will be \u00a32,000 a year for one child, \u00a34,000 a year for two children, and \u00a35,000 per year for three or more children.\n\nThe system of universal top-up payments is being replaced by the new system on April 6, after a three-month transitional period.\n\nSome \u00a32 billion in new funding will be handed to local councils in England to help pay for the cost of the new payments.\n\nMoney will be given to Scottish local authorities to help pay for the cost to the Scottish Government of the new system.\n\nHowever, it was reported that Theresa May rejected pleas from Gordon Brown to keep the previous system of top-up payments",
        "The quantity of goods bought rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was stronger growth than economists had been expecting. The rise of 0.9% from a year before meant the economy is now 1.7% larger than it was before the UK entered lockdown.\n\nHowever, the figures also show that the economy contracted sharply in June from the 2.4% rise seen in May.\n\nThe ONS said growth was driven by increases in sales of new cars, food, fuels and alcohol.\n\nThese all saw sales bounce back from the lockdown period, when shops were closed and restaurants, pubs and bars were not serving customers inside their premises.\n\nIn June, new car sales rose 26.2%, while new car registrations in the UK rose 28% year on year.\n\nHowever, other parts of the economy are faring less strongly.\n\nA slowdown in the service sector, sales of goods online, spending on household goods and car"
