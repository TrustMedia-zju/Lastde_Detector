But there is a key difference between the way the figures for business rate revenues are presented and the way figures for other taxes are presented. If the appeal outcome is more favourable to businesses, the government will get less money overall. Business rates are the taxes paid by commercial properties. They are collected by local authorities but go to central government. The government's figures on revenues from business rates are the amounts after any appeals have been settled.

The EU Commission has said it will \"step up\" measures to prevent migrant deaths at sea. Italy's Deputy Foreign Minister Mario Giro said Europe's response to the tragedy \"will be measured by the results\". He said it was not the first time such a large number of people had drowned, but added: \"This is the last warning. The issue is urgent,",

A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one.

The new Greek government will have to negotiate with its creditors, the other eurozone countries, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But it is not clear that the other eurozone countries and the European institutions will be willing to accept Syriza's proposals. The result could be a stalemate and a Greek exit from the eurozone. In the long term, a new system of currencies within the European Union may be required, but this requires new rules."
