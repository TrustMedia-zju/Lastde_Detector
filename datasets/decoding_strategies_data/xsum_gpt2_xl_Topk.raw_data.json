Kacou, speaking to Sky Sports, said he believed a deal for Bony was close to being finalised. \"It's about some small details about money but I think things will go all right in a few days,\" Kacou said. \"I will fly with him to Abu Dhabi and let's see what will happen.\" Kacou added no other clubs had bid for Bony, despite previous reported interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham. Instead it is Manchester City who seem set to sign Bony, who was the Premier League's top scorer in the calendar year of 2014 with 20 goals. \"Talks are going on and we are waiting but I really hope things will happen soon,\" Kacou added.

The airlines said it would also review the use of Taser guns on board. \"Korean Air will react more firmly and actively against in-flight violence that threatens the overall safety of the flight,\" it said in a statement. As part of the changes, the airline said it would be providing more training to staff and hiring more male flight attendants, making sure at least one male is on duty in the cabin for each flight, according to Reuters news agency. Marx's wife Daisy Fuentes, who was travelling with the singer, said the staff \"didn't know how to use the taser\" or to secure ropes.

One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production. Their concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC.

Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive.

The cabinet also backed a bill requiring any peace deal with the Palestinians to be put to a referendum. Palestinian sources have suggested peace talks, stalled since 2010, could restart next week. Some 104 long-term Palestinian prisoners will be released in four stages over a number of months, linked to progress in the peace process. In addition to the votes for and against in cabinet, there were two abstentions, a government official said. One source told Associated Press that two ministers from Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party voted no. Some of the prisoners have carried out militant attacks that claimed Israeli lives and were jailed for up to 30 years.

These efforts have been increased since the onset of the Ukraine crisis in 2014. Now Western media and governmental organisations are stepping up their efforts to reach out to Russian speakers. Just last week, the BBC said it was looking at plans for a new Russian satellite TV and video service. Meanwhile the EU's European External Action Service (EEAS) is preparing to launch a special anti-propaganda task-force aimed at Russian speakers in the EU and other parts of Eastern Europe. In January the European Parliament had urged the EU to develop \"a communication strategy to counter the Russian propaganda campaign\", in a strongly-worded resolution. The German and US-funded international broadcasters Deutsche Welle and Radio Liberty, as well as Euronews - part-funded by the EU - have also been boosting their Russian operations.

Others offered suggestions for where might be good to attack next, leading the Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Steve Kavanagh to say he would consider arresting Twitter users who appeared to incite violence.

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money provided either by the member states",

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: \"Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.\" The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020.

The section from Datchet in Berkshire to Teddington in London needs \u00a3300m for a flood channel and weir improvements. The Environment Agency said a lot of work had been done since last year. East Berkshire was one of the areas worst hit in the UK by the flooding in February 2014.

Images set to be released on Wednesday will be more than 10 times the resolution of those already published.

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year. Such lenders are unlikely to increase their SVRs until there has",

The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes. That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks. \"A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,\" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year.

In May 2011 he had to cope with the fall-out in Pakistan of the killing by US special forces of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad.

It happens about once a decade, because pitch is in such high demand: There's a need to build soundproofed windows; for underwater cables to be laid; or to build the new tunnels under the Arctic. When pitch drips from a funnel, it causes the sound to reverberate, which gives researchers some idea of how much air is in the pipe.\n\nWhen, some 1.5 kilometers away, the same funnel's puffs of air resonate at different frequencies, the speed of water in these water pipes is found to be at least 20 times lower than when the pipe is empty. So to get an accurate measurement, scientists must measure water flowing through the pipe - an impossible feat.\n\nNow, by using different methods, a team of researchers has used a computer program to calculate how small a volume of water might actually exist within the pipes.

The UK should form an \"outer-tier\" of the single market but allow freedom for other countries and companies to trade with the rest of the EU, as well as vice versa, he said. \"We want our companies to be in no less than 10 per cent of global trade and if that means we have to pay less, which it does, that has to be at the point of entry,\" Sadiq Khan has said.\n\nGETTY Theresa May wants the UK to leave the political union",
        "Budgets for investment, known as capital, have been raided in recent years by the Department of Health to help hospitals and other trusts in England cover the cost of the government's \"welfare cap\", which means that the poorest were now expected to pay more towards the health service.\"But there seems to be a gap between capital spending as a percentage of NHS spending and other countries with similar populations, such as Australia or New Zealand: In all three countries, capital spending as a share of national income is about two thirds below the level in England,\" said the report.\"However, in Australia and New Zealand, the capital spend in the NHS is far greater than in England \u2013 in Australia the total spend is over \u00a340bn, and in New Zealand it is over \u00a3150bn. This is a problem for the health budget.\"But because capital spending is heavily targeted to the least well-off in society, a more \"targeted\" approach to the health service will be needed,\" it added.",

        "Three officers were shot dead by an eastern European gang in a bungled east London burglary in December 1910. The murders led to the famous Siege of Sidney Street by the Metropolitan Police force. The first officer of the force was killed in this raid, and his second-in-command was shot dead in the street. Later, seven more officers were sentenced for their involvement, with two serving a total of 28 years.\n\nBut the 'Siege' would not have been possible without the involvement of a member of the Royal Family \u2013 the Queen's brother Prince Edward, the Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police. The Queen herself was one of the officers of the raid who were later found guilty.\n\nThe murders of the two policemen at Sidney Street shocked the nation, but few remembered that the Queen's brother was present at the scene.
