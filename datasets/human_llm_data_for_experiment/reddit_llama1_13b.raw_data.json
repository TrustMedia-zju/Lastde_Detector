        "Why does blood sugar spike after a meal if food is digested in the stomach for several hours before it starts getting absorbed in the small intestine? Great question! Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva.

You probably do not need that much, but that being said it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t benefit from that much if not more. If you are working out hard, in more bodybuilding style workouts looking to gain as much muscle mass possible, this isn\u2019t an unreasonable amount of protein.

        "If your leg gets amputated, how does your body know to not produce enough blood to replace what was lost? The answers so far are crappy. Yes the kidneys regulate blood pressure, and if that drops due to losing blood, they will simply stop producing urine to keep all the water inside the body and dilute the remaining blood to keep the pressure up, so it still goes places. But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin (called epo when talking about doping in sports). They produce more of there\u2019s less oxygen in the bloood.

        "Is it possible to see what ethnicity/race someone is just by looking at organs. For starters, race and ethnicity are social constructs. They are arbitrary lines drawn around perceived differences that have been reinforced via social structures. There is little to no genetic, physiological, or physical differentiation between different ethnicities or races that does not partially rely also on social classifications. Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\". Second, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone.

[This graphic](https://imgur.com/gallery/9KdKYPN) gives a detailed view of the inner workings of your throat. The trachea (gases) and esophagus (solids/liquids) are layered together. There are muscles and valves that close off to make sure liquid or solids don\u2019t enter the lungs while swallowing or vice versa air into the stomach while breathing. And why you shouldn\u2019t try to breathe in while drinking liquids (like drinking while heavy panting after exercise or thinking water will help while choking\u2026) When you either accidentally override the automatic muscle closures or are too incapacitated to close those muscles properly anymore you get what\u2019s called \u201caspiration\u201d.

This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards. Scientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with",

There's a combination of reasons. The most significant one is that cheese mold itself usually isn't dangerous. Most varieties of mold that commonly grow on cheese just changd the flavor. They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content.

I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander. When you mouth breathe, your tongue is down and you're not wearing",
        "How and why can some metals like copper be antibacterial? It is important to remember that bacteria and cells aren't like us. Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage. Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth. The second big thing to remember is that all living things are essentially just chemical processes. You put two molecules",

Given the 5% body weight you say is necessary to occlude a skin capillary (at what blood pressure, by the way, since blood pressure would have a large impact on that), it seems unlikely that simple shifts in stance (eg swaying) would be significant enough to reduce occlusion pressure below critical opening pressure of the capillaries. So why don't the tissues of the sole of the feet become rapidly damaged in people who stand all day? 15 minutes of ischemia is enough to cause cell death, so people who spend hours standing in one place (such as grocery store clerks) should be experiencing numerous lesions on the sole of their foot, no?

        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform",

The premise of the question is wrong. If you dove to the bottom of the ocean you would not implode. As the pressure rises, the air-filled spaces in your body would get smaller. Your lungs would shrink down, so your ribs would move inward like they do when you exhale. Your sinuses and inner ears would fill with water. But that\u2019s it.

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed.

At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or",
        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. Before germ theory, people believed in Humorism or the four humors. They were yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit. To anyone who finds this interesting: there\u2019s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels. When it separates, you see the dark clots at the bottom (black bile), the",

They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you",

Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4.

The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work.

When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain.

In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination.

They believe the body has \u201cinnate intelligence\u201d, the ability to heal itself. And that all health issues are due to subluxations in the spine preventing this \u201cinnate intelligence\u201d from flowing and healing the body. Thus the back and neck cracking. Let\u2019s talk about that neck cracking. Did you know there have been cases of chiropractors cracking peoples necks",

You shouldn\u2019t put anything in your ears if your goal is to take wax out, because that doesn\u2019t solve the problem you\u2019re trying to fix. Inevitably you will pack at least some wax further down. If you pack it too far down, it becomes impacted and can\u2019t be naturally expelled like it should through the outward growth of the skin of your ear canal (from deep to shallow, like a conveyer belt moving wax to the surface). These archimedes-screw cleaners are just as likely to impact wax as a q-tip is. If you don\u2019t have an expert looking into your ear to check, how do you know you",

I mean, it only takes a few minutes a day. Regular cleanings, x-rays, and dental checkups are important, but for at least some people, probably not a strict requirement for reasonable dental health if they brush and floss. Remember, a lot of people in the world don't have *any* access to dental care whatsoever, and their teeth are still probably in better shape than the teeth of a prehistoric person. But more to your point, you kind of answered your question in your question. As you correctly pointed out. part of it is that we live a lot longer on average now than we used to. Preventative dental care is a lot more important if you're going to live",

Mum was thin all her life till she hit 60. In other words she didn't start creating an over abundance of new fat cells till then. Unfortunately this new fat cell creation was post menopause and thus her body distributed it more like a male with most of it going on the belly viscerally. Not yet understanding why she had a more male distribution, but I recognised the danger about 5 years ago when a random YT video appeared in my feed about an autopsy of a 70yo woman from Heart disease and a heart attack. The woman on the slab was the exact shape my mother had become. Scared the life out of me and for the last",

They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to",

It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right",

Once the baby is born, the placenta, which used to be stuck to the wall of the womb to help get nutrients from mother to baby, will detach and come out of the mother\u2019s body naturally, usually within about 15 minutes. Once it\u2019s detached, the blood flow stops, and it dies like any other organ that\u2019s been cut off, and no longer does anything to help the baby. If left alone, the cord will slowly dry out, but it\u2019s easy to irritate the stump caring for the baby and could cause an infection, think like how you can get an infection by picking the skin around a scab too early, only a baby is a lot more likely to get one.

        "Why is water essential for life on other planets? Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that\u2019s strong enough to allow for incredibly complex chemistry and yet won\u2019t dissolve the molecules that make up the organism. If life is carbon-based, water\u2019s really the only solvent that fits the bill. And while it\u2019s technically possible that there could be life that\u2019s not carbon-based, it\u2019s probably unlikely. This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y\u2019know, live. The way carbon forms strong covalent bonds with itself means it can form molecules like DNA in a way that other atoms just can\u2019t. And even the few elements that can, like silicon, don\u2019t form long",

        "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses? When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patrollers. If evaded, the virus starts infecting and multiplying, and it takes a little while for the immune system to notice. When it does though\u2026 it\u2019s war. First the innate system notices and begins to attack. White blood cells eat, spray acid, and rip themselves apart to deploy DNA webs. Macrophages join and attack. Inflammatory processes are activated. Complement proteins flood the area. Natural killer cells execute any cells that don\u2019t look healthy. Debris accumulates, including virus parts. Then dendrites wander in and pick up the virus parts. They then float around the body until they encounter a dormant T cell with just the right receptors. This meeting is a serious one, with a two part confirmation. The lock clicks and then the dendritic cell confirms and twists the activation key. The T Cell turns on ready",

People's DNA determine how they handle foods and poisons. So does their diet. For instance, when I looked through my digital genome (a huge file, I found that I had six copies of the gene that encodes for a liver pathway called \"P450\". P450 processes many chemicals; ethanol, caffeine, warfarin (blood thinner). Having more copies of this gene means I don't get as drunk by alcohol (I process it three times faster). 23andMe call this \"less likely to drink coffee\", because I don't get stimulated by it. Sounds great, but P450 makes Acetaldehyde from ethanol. Which is waaay more toxic than ethanol. It's causes inflammation in joints, and the brain. To process",
        "why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses? Wild horses who can't cope without them die:) But the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means",

Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with. A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during. Spiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses. Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating",

Resistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section. The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*. But area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry.

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it\u2019s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don\u2019t the bladder",

An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales).

Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators.

However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed.",
        "why do humans require so many types of food to be healthy when many animals can eat one thing? Humans (and all other things) evolved to minimize their need for THEIR most scarce resource. If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy. A mutation that makes use lose the ability to make vitamin C means we no longer waste that energy. If",

Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will",

And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a",

Harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-splicing system is completely changing the outlook for this type of sickness. CRISPR-Cas9 is an immune system for bacteria. It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body.

Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density.

I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual",

Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus.

So, if they are in fact 'alive' what makes Copper as an antibacterial? Copper is an antibacterial metal that can kill bacteria in both Gram positive and negative bacteria. The ability of copper dopes, such as silver, have made these types of ions very popular. These copper dopes are often utilized in the medical field to help sterile the environment surrounding the hospital rooms of sick individuals and help prevent the spread of diseases or infections. Furthermore, these dopes help prevent patients from getting infections and will assist in the recovery of",

        "how are blood vessels under the feet not compressed to the point of blockage when standing? >During walking and standing balance the moments of the weight of the body acts at a distance from the center of the pelvis (the spinal column), and this pushes up the blood flow. This can be seen and felt when standing and then shifting body weight from one leg to the next. When we shift the weight pressure to the right the body shifts the right leg forward to stand on the tip of the toes to take the balance strain of the body. The strain and pressure from the shifting weight on the right transfers through the calf muscle and veins into the feet and this will result on temporary increased pressure on the venus that supply the toes, which in turn will increase the pressure in the toes veins to the point of causing blockage at a temporary or permanent basis. On the left side it is the other way round",

When you are diving with the bubbles coming in and out of solution. When we talk about diving, we are talking about dissolved in the bloodstream. We are talking about, if you are diving down to great depth, the pressures in that environment. That pressure is higher than in the ambient pressure. So, the atmospheric pressure, so you're going down, going higher pressure. When you dive back up to air pressure, bubbles form. Those bubbles or gas form can lead to compression sickness and that is really a blood gas barrier where that bubble gets big. And when it is released it causes tissue damage.\nAir in dives is just that simple. The tissues can die from the gas",

E.g. whiskey, brandy, gin contain corrosive acids which irritate the throat even more when the inflammation is still present.\nBesides alcohol, other elements in alcoholic drinks will irritate the throat further. e.g. tea contains tannin. E.g. caffeine in coffee. Alcoholic drinks tend to dilate the blood vessels. When the vessels become dilated, blood rises to head, leaving body organs with less blood and oxygen; brain is not the only organ not to function well; the throat will be less moisturised.

        "if a person was able to free dive to the bottom of the ocean, they would reach a point where the crushing pressure would cause them to loose consciousness. When one dies from a lack of oxygen, oxygen deprivation causes the brain, the person's vital life force, to shut down first and then the body follows suit. Because the human body is an extremely efficient self-regulating machine, it would not allow itself to go into an environment with pressures that it could not survive so the brain can protect it self from the outside. Also it seems it would take a lot of planning and a lot of money to develop a pressurized suit to withstand the ocean's forces, and probably some serious brain damage from the person not being able to breathe under that amount of pressure.\nAnyway, to say that a ghost might be a living person who has lost consciousness and is at the bottom of the ocean sounds quite",

Eating an orange or any other fruit is better for your blood sugar than drinking fruit juice. Whole fruits contain the natural fruit sugars and also the fiber which slows down the absorption of the sugar, which also blunts the peak of the blood glucose response.

        "Why do some medications say to not consume grapefruit while taking them? Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot, and Starfruit all contain the same compound that blocks an enzyme in the liver that metabolize many medications. If the enzyme is blocked, the medication stays in the body longer. For most patients, it is the metabolite that causes the problems. This can lead to higher and/or lower than anticipated blood levels, which leads to higher and/or lower than anticipated medication effect. However, if you have kidney disease, there can be problems metabolizing medications in the liver. Consuming grapefruit, pommelos, bergamot or starfruit may be problematic in this setting as well.

After the operation, a surgeon removes any clips or clamps, loosens the tournequit or carefully watches the blood flow to ensure that it is restored within an appropriate period of time. If the clamps and clips are left on for too long, they will cause a problem that is called a hematoma...and it can be a big one in some cases.\nA hematoma occurs when blood clots or coagulates in the area of a surgical incision.

        "How do babies learn a language when they are not taught it in a structured manner? These answers may be correct, but they do not really address the actual question. A more complete explanation would be that human babies, just like most animals in the world , have a natural instinct for the language(s) that their parents speak. This is the result of millennia of evolution of the human species: as soon as they come to earth, they are able to recognise the language (or languages) spoken by the people around them, and can use these to communicate with their community.\nThis is of course fascinating!

Melatonin is responsible for the relaxation and tranquil feelings we have right before we fall asleep.\nMy point being: When you hold it during the day you end up causing your bladder muscles to contract and when you go to pass urine you cant due to that contraction. The problem is that if you don't pass urine you feel the effect of it staying in your bladder which leads to more severe bladder spasms. When you fall asleep the bladder naturally relaxes allowing you to pass your urine safely. When you first wake up or get out of bed your body still has a leftover amount of Melatonin which causes the bladder to stay relaxed. The longer you stay in bed",

Thank you!\nJuan R G\nasked by Juan R G\nPosted by John Johnson on 5/27/2018 9:00:32 AM\nPosted by Juan R G on 5/28/2018 1:02:54 AM\nYou need to get some kind of doctorate for your background to answer these kinds of questions.\nI am a microbiologist as well, and we have some specialized equipment to help us detect which foods may be contaminated.\nOne of the more common tests that people will do if they suspect that their food may be contaminated with e. coli",
        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One possibility is that brain power is a byproduct of our large size and upright posture. Humans are roughly _x_ 7 larger than chimpanzees, yet our brain is roughly the _x_ 4 the size of a chimpanzee's. The ratio of brain-to-body mass was probably much greater in the ancestors of hominids, and if this trend continued, the increase in the size of the hominin brain may have given it the ability to store increasingly more information\u2014information that may have in turn been the spark for innovation and invention.\nWe saw that as bipedal hominins got larger and their hands became freed from walking, they had the opportunity to begin to use tools. But bipedalism didn",
        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next day? The answer lies in the fact that muscle soreness is not a direct result of physical activity, but occurs as the result of chemicals leaking from the muscle tissue during and after activity.\nThe most common trigger for muscle soreness is eccentric muscle exercise. Eccentric exercise is a form of exercise in which the muscle lengthens during movement and shortens during rest. For example, the biceps work eccentrically when you lower a weight after lifting it high. Other examples include walking down stairs and coming down slowly.\nMany people believe that lactic acid is a primary cause of muscle soreness, but this has not been proven. The chemical that is most responsible for the soreness is histamine, but research has shown that the amount of histam",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to answer this question is to explain why a normal functioning body stores excess calories as adipose tissue. Then, it will be easier to discuss the factors that lead to obesity.\nThe best way to put it is that the body is a storage unit for fat calories. Fat calories are easily stored in adipose tissue in the form of triglyceride. Our bodies will continue to store excess fat calories to the point where it starts to cause health problems, because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be. As a storage unit, fat is meant to be stored and released back into the bloodstream when they are needed most.\nIf we consume food with more than enough calories than are spent in the body, then excess calories are turned into triglycerides",
        "If both liver and kidneys are cleaning the blood, what's the difference between them? The liver's primary job in keeping us healthy is removing chemical impurities from our blood. That means taking stuff out of our blood by destroying the toxins in them. Those toxic chemicals are removed by breaking them down into smaller substances and then flushing them out of the blood. Once the toxins break down into smaller pieces, they're excreted in the urine and sweat. Most of these substances are filtered out by the kidneys because they're made mostly of water-based substances. Urine may still appear yellow if there's still some left in the blood, but the body does an admirable job of cleaning itself of all the toxins through the kidneys.\nWhat we eat and drink has a direct effect on how well those organs work.

        "Does reading fiction activate different parts of the brain than watching TV or scrolling through social media? I am a musician and also a truck driver, so it\u2019s challenging to find time for other pursuits like reading, or even listening to music in the cab of the truck. How do you strike that balance?\nI\u2019m an elementary school teacher and always curious where my grade 4 students are in their reading. I have a question for you, I was talking with a professor of education and he told me that he uses the formula: The number of words in a grade 4 text * age of the pupil -5. So for our average student of say 10 years old, it would be 54-5 and it would be appropriate for them to tackle. Your thoughts?\nThank you so much for speaking today in Toronto. I loved every minute of it. Thank you, too, for your wonderful books \u2013 I am reading",
        "How do STDs work exactly? So pathogens have existed longer than we have. Bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses have had hundreds of millions of years to evolve to infect humans. They are much better at it than we are at resisting them. This was not a problem until we invented agriculture and started living in large sedentary communities in large numbers.\nBefore that life was very different. Small nomadic groups moved around, always looking for better spots to set down roots. If a particular place was good enough for a long time, populations would grow and eventually a new place would need to be found. These kinds of people could take risks, they would be killed off by any disease that was too aggressive to let people get a warning beforehand and go someplace safer. They were also much healthier.\nIt was after the Agriculture Revolution where populations grew too stable and too large",
        "What happens to your body when you participate in a marathon Long distance running problems/risks (and the things you describe) in no particular order: 1. Chafing Running long distances causes you to produce a lot of sweat. If you don\u2019t move this moisture out of the way as you run it can make your skin very irritated \u2014 if not downright break it down. So run and wear clothes that are made to reduce friction, like cotton, or wear long sleeve tights or shorts. If your skin breaks down too bad sometimes you get a bad blister and that can be hard on both your mind and your feet. 2. Blisters and Cuts If you start to cut your skin down to the ground in order to get a blister or something, that starts to become a very serious issue when it gets down to the bone and you have more problems than just a sore on",
        "Refrigerate after opening, but not before? You're right about most dairy products being only pasteurized except for UHT, but the stuff is usually kept in the fridge after opening.\nLow fat milk always goes sour/off quicker than full fat does (because it has fewer natural antibacterial agents in the milk to combat bacteria growth, and the presence of bacteria in a little bit of milk creates a greater proliferative advantage for the bacteria than in low-bacteria content). The full cream products keep longer due to the higher fat content, as with any milk-based product that has added cream, which is also why cream products often last longer than the non-cream versions.\nI don't think the difference between whole milk UHT and low-fat UHT is actually substantial, the \"off\" tastes of UHT are the tast",
        "Why does salt make everything taste better? Why do humans like it? Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain myths, some are just explanations of the physiological effects of salt on the body. But how about a few answers from more of a culinary science perspective.\nHere is one answer which I find fascinating. Humans have evolved to favor saltiness to a high degree. While the article calls it a \"culinary adaptation\", it has clearly evolved as a flavoring mechanism.\nOne could argue that as we have moved further away from a more natural diet, our desire for \"unhealthy\" salt has grown. As a result, we are consuming a good deal more salt than is good for us.\nHowever, it goes right back to the culinary aspect. Many of the meals we cook, are not that healthy, especially when they use higher salt than they should.",
        "Why puking gives us so much relief after feeling sick and nauseous? \"Because the process of vomiting is really hard on your body, \" said Dr. David. \"It's kind of like getting the worst part over because your system is so focused on getting rid of it. You expel it and then you rest.\". The body is a complex machine requiring a good working.\nThe process of vomiting can be a result of gastrointestinal, cardiac, or medicinal causes. Here we shall focus on vomiting as a symptom. Symptoms may include depression, headache, nausea, irritability, anorexia, and weight loss. Vomiting often follows a cycle. This generally starts with dry heaving, followed by a gush.\nIt is always useful to try to determine why you have been sick after eating. If you do not feel better after vomiting or if you",
        "When you go to sleep weighing a certain amount and wake up weighing less. Where did that weight go? There are several schools of thought on how a person might lose weight without trying, or even noticing. You read my article, How I Lost 15 Pounds In 7 Days. How did I do it? I tried to eat like everyone else around me, but somehow I just stopped eating, literally.\nYou might have gained weight because you started taking steroids for a football injury, or you were overworked and underfed. Maybe you became ill and the medicine caused you to gain, or you have thyroid issues that cause you to gain weight.\nOr you could be on antibiotics. This is a very common cause for weight gain. You might be on a high FODMAP diet that causes you to lose weight, not because you have been trying, but because you just don\u2019t have",
        "Why do human hips go bad so randomly? You\u2019d think runners and other athletes would get bad hips pretty often, but the opposite seems to hold. In medical studies, you rarely see athletes with arthritis. It\u2019s usually the couch potatoes who ruin themselves.\nI think the difference comes from muscular imbalance. Your human hips, like any other part of your body, is supposed to work properly. Unfortunately, some of us don\u2019t have the balanced musculature to keep the hips in place. As a result, one hip, or side of the thigh, develops an imbalance with the other side, causing the hip to go bad way too quickly. Fortunately, there is a very simple solution to keeping the hips healthy: hip strength (which we know is also great if you\u2019re a runner).\nThe two most common muscles that go out are",
        "what actually happens in your body when you become more fit? Great question, and love the answers. I started running 3 years ago, ran my first race 2 years ago this week. I've always been a runner and always been athletic. Running isn't new to me but, my love for it has taken me down a path I never knew existed.\nSo... what is different now then when I started this fitness journey?\nSometimes you just have to step back and take stock of where you've been and where you're headed. I ran a 1/2 marathon in April of 2014... 2 year anniversary approaching. What a journey. My coach and I talked about how to get to the next level and what our next race would be and I realized I wasn't even thinking about what that goal would be. I'm still not.",
        "Why is sodium fluoride added to the toothpaste when it's calcium fluoride that is actually helping the teeth? I thought it was only in the water to help prevent cavities. The calcium fluoride is more absorbent, but maybe it's not as reactive...?\nI'd be surprised if there wasn't, seeing as calcium is the most abundant of the two. And sodium is pretty cheap. I think maybe the ratio of potassium in fluoride is a bit \"off\" in that if your tooth is in your mouth (and thus, is continually submerged in saliva), then you would get more potassium from fluoride in your saliva. But the concentration is much higher in your saliva than in the toothpaste, so maybe it's a wash?\nBUT: I doubt they've done extensive research on this,",
        "Why can we get HIV to a viral load of 0 but can't get rid of the virus? So a good bit of our HIV positive friends appear to be \"HIV negative\" on tests, but their viral load is still undectable. Is there any hope that we can get the virus down to 0?\nWhat's undetectable?\nUndectable means that there is less than a certain level or amount. It can be used to describe certain viral loads, it can be used to describe levels of certain chemical substances. It can also be used to describe the presence/ non-presence of a certain thing.\nFor example if you say your cancer is undectable - that means the cancer is low. If you say you are on drugs that are undectable that means there are none of the drugs left in your system. If you say this new type of HIV is undectable"
