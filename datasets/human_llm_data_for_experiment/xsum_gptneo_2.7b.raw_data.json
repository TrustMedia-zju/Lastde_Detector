Ministers had \"made a mistake\" by rushing the measure through, she said. \"It's leaving a lot of women out of pocket,\" she told BBC's Woman's Hour. Plans to increase the state pension age for women from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020 were initially set out in 1995. 'Undue hardship' But the coalition government decided to speed up the process in 2011, resulting in the state pension age for women increasing to 65 in November 2018 and then to 66 by October 2020.

However, Sanmi Odelusi and Nathan Delfouneso clinched victory for the Seasiders with late strikes. Potts fired his side ahead in the 33rd minute, arriving late in the box to convert Colin Daniel's cross from the left. Blackpool added a second in the 56th minute when Luke Joyce was caught in possession and Flores took advantage to unleash a fierce strike into the corner. Flores missed a chance to make it 3-0 and Carlisle hit back when substitute Ibehre headed home.

Reality Check verdict: The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: \"Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.\" The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year. But the other part is a bit more complicated - it",

VW faces a flood of actions and has set aside \u20ac16.2bn to cover the lawsuits. The court said it brought in extra staff to process the claims submitted by shareholders, who were concerned that 18 September, the day VW's manipulations were uncovered a year ago, may be the deadline to file. It said most of the cases were bundled actions containing claims from multiple plaintiffs, in many cases private investors. The scandal broke after an investigation found that many Volkswagen cars being sold in America had software in diesel engines that",

They are fiercely proud of where they live and about being self sufficient. The family grows its own food - they have two dairy cows, pigs, sheep, geese, ducks and hens. Mum Sasha, 36, runs a pony trekking business while her 42-year-old husband, Iain, supplements the household income by gathering and selling scrap metal. The couple's four children - Sarah, Ryan, Ewan and Douglas - help with the running of the croft and pitch in looking after the livestock and the trekking business's 19 horses. The effort to heat and light the crofthouse, however, dominates family life. The croft is not connected to the National Grid and the family gets its electricity from a generator and a small wind turbine. But when diesel levels are low and the wind does not blow, the TV and domestic appliances are out of action and the children have to do their homework by",

        "Leading economist Lord Nicholas Stern said that a commitment to sustainable development was more important than a binding deal that \"lacked credibility\". He was speaking in Lima, Peru, where negotiators from 194 countries are heading into a second week of UN talks. They hope to agree a text that would form the basis of new global compact, to be signed in Paris next year. Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon. According to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format. \"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said. \"That, in my view, is a serious mistake. The sanctions available under the Kyoto Protocol, for example, were notionally legally-binding but were simply not credible and failed to guarantee",

It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed. Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up. The invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama.

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year. Such lenders",

For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money provided either by the member states themselves or by the",

        "Three officers were shot dead by an eastern European gang in a bungled east London burglary in December 1910. The murders led to the famous Siege of Sidney Street in the borough of Hackney as well as to the formation of the Metropolitan Police. The gang\u2019s leader and another man, Henry Miller, was sentenced to 20 years in prison but never served his term. The gang is thought to have included many ethnic Germans, Jewish refugees, and British-born anarchists.\n\nThe siege is one of several tales of the London anarchists. Another, about a prison riot, is the story of Guy Fawkes burning off the British Parliament in 1605.\n\nAnarchists came out of the French Revolution in great numbers and came to London by ship. The majority had been raised on anarchist books sent by the anarchist commune in Brussels.\n\nThe first British anarchist to be killed, Peter Kropotkin, was shot in May 1864 by a constable who believed he was a",
        "His is the first elected government in Pakistan to serve a full term. But since taking the helm in September 2008, Mr Zardari has presided over the biggest deterioration of basic services across Pakistan, from the nation's water, electricity and other utilities, to its road and rail infrastructure and telecommunications systems. The country's economy's annual growth rate has plunged from nearly 7% in 2005 to barely under 2.6%, a decline that has slowed recently but remains slower than the pace of inflation.\n\nSince Mr Zardari took up his post, Pakistan's economic growth has fallen from 11% in 2005 to 3.8% last year, a decline of nearly half. Unemployment has doubled from 12% to 23% \u2013 an increase, some economists say, even faster than the actual increase in the country's population. On top of this, much of the country's debt has been sold to China, which has been using it as collateral in its $US6 billion of purchases.\n\nMr",
        "Dr Paul Wright told the BBC that the Caribbean island's anti-doping regime had been woefully short of the international standards required. His comments come as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the United Nations' executive body for anti-doping and drug testing, called for the testing of blood and spunkies.\n\nWith this comes the first international regulation as well as testing of urine on sport stars, a system known as Bio-Ethical Standards, which is designed to ensure athletes have a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle.\n\nAs WADA explains: \"The Bio-Ethical Standards of the sport of cycling are a step towards more realistic expectations of compliance with the fundamental requirements in areas such as drug testing, nutrition and work to be taken to improve performance.\"\n\nThe announcement comes two days after the European Medical Agency (EMA) issued a report in the journal Health Policy.

        "Rangers confirmed that Jardine had lost an 18-month battle against cancer on Thursday evening. He was part of their European Cup Winners' Cup-winning squad of 1998, but the club had never given him the recognition he deserved.\n\nHis career was delayed when, at just 19, he broke his spine while playing professional football for Scottish side Motherwell FC.\n\nHe made his Liverpool debut in May 1990 - and never left. For the first half of a decade, the Scottish international spent more years at Anfield than any other club's top three paid him.\n\nJardine was instrumental in the successful European campaigns of 1990-92 and 1995-97, playing an important role in England's progression in the quarter-finals both campaigns.\n\nHe played nearly 400 times for the club, including a hat-trick in their 1994 Cup-clinching victory over Anderlecht, and went onto become arguably the finest player to wear the Reds' number four",
        "That is not a surprise because Benitez is managing the same players as his predecessor Steve McClaren, so they are going to have the same issues as well without a major shakeup.\n\nBut what was curious about Benitez, who did not name a new number-one, was his comments. He said that the league did not have any problem with Newcastle's behaviour in the run-up to a possible move to the Chinese league. He added: \"When we look at all the clubs in England now, and at the number of clubs who have a problem with us in the past and are not happy, we do not see any problem at Newcastle United\".\n\nIt is unlikely we will get further answers as long as Alan Pardew is at the helm as the United Supporters Trust will not vote for anyone other than Pardew, and will not have their own candidate. But if he does get the job he will have the biggest challenge of them all.\n\n",
        "But it serves as an important in-depth account of the state of the NHS in England. The opening pages, inevitably, emphasise the positives - a strong focus on prevention is one - and the downsides (the absence of a full public finance bill, the high cost of care for patients who have been deemed too expensive, the high cost of consultants who are in fact on the market for very well established practices), the latter ones being more fully explored in the chapters entitled 'The Care System: Where Do We Go from Here?' and 'The Future: A Time for Change?' Finally, and despite all the above, the book maintains a healthy dose of optimism and positive outlook towards the future of the National Health Service itself.\n\nThe book, by two independent experts, offers a good overview of the challenges facing the National Health Service today. Unfortunately, however, it does not offer any real solutions to them. The book is full of good ideas, but the authors have little to say on",
