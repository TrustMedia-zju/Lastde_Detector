Ragged romance novels and cheap paperback mystery novels were crammed haphazardly on the shelves. The books had always been for sale; they were a fixture in the Coffee Shoppe, much like the strange owner, who opened when he rolled out of bed, closed when he got tired, and would tell anyone who would listen how he thought that the universe was created specifically for jackrabbits, and weren't we all lucky we humans got to tag along for the ride. The Coffee Shoppe had been there a week from yesterday, or forever, depending on who you asked. No matter how long the business had been there, the Coffee Shoppe was both old and new at the same time. No matter. The Reading Room of the Coffee Shoppe was the greatest room in the entire town, maybe even",

It turned out that our biosphere was in fact a fledgling hivemind. All living creatures, from mould to unladen European swallows, were interconnected. Normally the network remained dormant. But when with a googol amount of beetle eyes seeing it at once, the sight of an invasion force woke up the Earth itself. Humanity and some other species near to us in complexity were still distinct. Our sentience meant we were more than just mind controlled shock troops. We got the signals, but each of us could directly speak to the planet itself. And through the planet....

There are a couple of different types, and I'm not really read up on how they all work, but I'll try to explain them. Most prominent is blue magic. Blue mages are typically either elementalists or conjurers, and my sister Eleanor is the latter. She took fencing classes in college, so she uses her magic to compress the mana in the air into the solid form of a rapier. Her daughter Marie practices both fencing and kendo, but she can't use magic. Personally, I think it's because she's a latent Silver mage, like her father was. See, Silver mages generate power within their bodies, unlike other kinds who have to pull it from the environment. It manifests as a silver flame, and what it does varies immensely from one person to the next. But someone can't learn Silver magic, they have to",

His friends were cowards and ran away when they saw the corpse. Jonathan was no coward, and his friends were probably liars. He kept search the cave until he found it. There it was, a skeleton, a sword in a scabbard, and surprisingly a note written in old dried blood on the cave wall. \"Do not trust her song.\" Jonathan snatched up the sword sneering at the warning. When he drew the blade from it's scabbard it immediately began to sing it's Siren's Song. Scarlet fire wreathed the blade as it sang. Jonathan in shock dropped the sword, but it was too late, she'd already infected his mind. Jonathan's mind seared and he dropped to his knees. Scarlet",

With a lot of time and money gone to work on the land on Terra, the government decided it was a great time to let the people in.\n\nThe government decided to send people on the colonies to try and get some of the missing technology. They wanted to make Terra a place of safety",

        "A peaceful alien race is besieged by another race in the same galaxy. As their last planets fall and their home-world comes under threat they do the only thing they can do. They fight back.\n\nI am not a fan of the war between the Covenant and the Flood. I've been making a lot of the same arguments for some time, and in the process of writing the history I realize I'm going to lose those arguments. But for now, I will stand by them. This is really the best way to understand the Covenant/Flood conflict. It makes a lot of sense, and it means that all the characters can act in ways consistent with the history they would have written into the universe, not the kind of history I would have made up for myself.\n\nSo I'm posting the version of this short story I am publishing in my anthology, From Eternity to Here. It is an extended version of this essay, with additions and changes as needed over time. I",
        "Your name is Death. You work 168 hours a week as the reaper of souls on planet Earth. You're living on just a couple bucks above minimum wage, because you can't afford to live somewhere else. This makes your day job just bearable. To make a living, you have to work in exchange for the services of hundreds of other workers. And so now, you're in the business of making sure these people die.\n\nThe way a human dies is kind of a big deal. Most people assume it has to do with the way their brain works, but it actually has nothing to do with that. In fact, the process that a human follows in death is surprisingly easy, and you, Death, know the way each person dies intimately. You've killed billions of people in your lifetime. You see the end, and you know exactly what happens. In the end, it's all about the way a person dies.\n\nThis all starts with the person themselves.",
        "One day, everyone in the world wakes up with a tattoo depicting how they will die on them. You don't have one. \"Ah ahaha my family must be really stupid with these names. This is a very difficult game. I bet you've never played it and I bet you're going to get a tattoo very soon.\" The next day, you see her. A young woman, probably with a lot of life ahead: her face is slightly pale, and when she turns she reveals a tattoo of a man crying. \"No way, this girl has a tattoo on her. No one in my family has ever thought about this kind of situation except me.\"\n\nThat is how you end up here, in the darkest area of The Spire, a city on top of one that is, and only one that truly is, called the World.\n\nThe Spire\n\nThe Spire is a great city built on the bones of another and it floats. It's an",
        "With fewer adventurers coming to the dungeons these days, an evil overlord considers budget cuts. \"So we're down 10 foolish souls from last month, now, what do we do about this? Hmm, the way to solve this dilemma is not by lowering the entry fees or the prices for equipment, because those things don't work anyway, so what do we do? \"The way I see it, we just go back and have a look and see if we can find more gold. It might not be our fault that we lost so many foolish souls, after all.\".\n\nWhat's the use?\nSo, you're asking us if you should try to get the most amount of gold and equipment you can now, when that's more likely to cause more harm than good in the long term.\nIf you want more powerful equipment, you'll get more powerful equipment when you actually level to your next tier, be sure to get to that!\n\nGathering in different places",
        "There is actually a god, but it is unlike any religion's god. \"The day Golumpolorpe (pronounced Go-Lump-por-pe) was created as a god\" is the story my Great-Grandmother told us. This god was made out of the tears of all of the sadness she ever felt. You know how people cry more than anything else? Me, myself and I, are the only people that ever see the tears, because the rest of our family all look perfect; we all have perfect skin. Golumpolorpe did all the crying and all the sadness, so she created all the joy. If we don't see a rainbow, we don't have a rainbow, we don't see green leaves, you know. Everything comes back to Golumpolorpe, so we can still feel the joy she made when nothing else can.\n\nThe legend says that Golumpolorpe's tears got really stuck in the fabric that goes over her",
        "For almost 15 years, a group of players has met every week, rain or shine, to play Dungeons and Dragons. They are just now starting to see some of the changes that are coming to the game, and even then, those changes don't seem to be as big as many expected. Instead, there is talk of more changes than any player can really digest.\n\nDungeons & Dragons, as you may have guessed from the name, is a game in which groups of adventurers travel throughout the dungeon, fighting monsters and collecting treasure. The game is designed for the players to create their own stories, to lead their own adventures, without any direction from the players' handbooks.\n\nFor a while now, Dungeons & Dragons has been trying to appeal to a wider audience. Players have been given some rules on creating their characters, but beyond that, the game has always allowed players to do what they want. It is a system where the players (and the Dungeon Master who runs the",
        "Every person in the world undergoes a \"goodness\" test. It's designed to give a score from 1 to 200, where 1 is pure evil and 200 is pure goodness. The exact test is described in the following post. Every person has their own score. The \"world average\" may be in the vicinity of 120; it's hard to find out. A score in the mid-50s is considered pretty good, for example. Some scores over 170 are considered \"truly evil\". Some people have very high scores (around 200) but no one's ever claimed to know the \"cause\" of the test, whether it has anything to do with genetics or just the fact that most people are kind.\n\nAnyway, if everyone goes through a \"goodness\" test then you and your parents would be about average. You've just had your test, however, so you have a new score. Your father has now had his test also, and so on. At the",
        "Short story that takes place in a single elevator ride. I entered the elevator, rubbing my eyes and yawning. I felt as good as dead. I was going to my own funeral.\n\nAs the car starts to descend, I feel an arm around my shoulder, gently, slowly guiding me down. Then I smell someone's perfume and my eyes begin to open. It's the woman in the pink shirt, who has a soft voice. \"Just relax\" as the elevator dawdles its way to the ground. \"You might actually enjoy this\" she tells me, patting my shoulder. When the door opens, she escorts me out to a limo where all of my friends gather. I stand there numbly, looking at everyone. The woman in pink steps over towards me while I stand numbly looking at them. She bends, and whispers to me \"You're about to have an adventure. You're going to a party\".\n\nI'm sitting in",
