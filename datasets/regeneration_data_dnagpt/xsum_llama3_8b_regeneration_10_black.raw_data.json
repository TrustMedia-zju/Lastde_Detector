The government's long-awaited backing for a third runway at Heathrow Airport has been delayed by years of delay but supporters say the issue is finally on the agenda. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin revealed on Thursday that the government would make a final decision on the expansion of Heathrow before the London Assembly meets to debate it on Monday. But in a Commons statement, Prime Minister David Cameron described that process as \"unnecessary\". Mr Cameron made his case for expanding the airport in a speech in 2007",

The government's long-awaited backing for a third runway at Heathrow was set out in its Transport White Paper. It will open up an extra runway at Heathrow for the first time in 30 years, and give the go-ahead for a sixth runway as soon as 2025. But the decision sparked anger and protests including from some MPs. Shadow transport secretary Chris Grayling, was forced to make a swift U-turn on the plans in a statement on Twitter on Wednesday.

On 16 December 1910, a gang of Latvian revolutionaries tried to rob a jeweller's shop in Houndsditch. The gang fired on unarmed officers, killing three and seriously injuring two. City of London Police later named as leaders of the gang in a newspaper appeal. Police called for information about the three dead officers, hoping their murder would lead to an investigation by the New Scotland Yard force, which had been established four months earlier. A fourth officer was gravely wounded during the shootout.\n\nAt the time the officers were shot, Sidney Street was a busy working-class community in east London, but following the outbreak of"

The Welsh government has said it is working to improve services and support for those with muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe of the muscular dystrophies, according to the Action Duchenne charity. The charity said the disease, which affects mainly boys, was 100% fatal. Sufferers are diagnosed usually by the age of five and without good medical intervention they rarely live beyond their late teens and twenties, it said. Wales was the only country in the UK to screen newborn children for the condition, but screening was withdrawn at the end of November. The Welsh government said the test was no longer reliable. Around 100 parents and campaigners gathering at the Welsh assembly on Tuesday are also seeking matched funding to support new research that could deliver a cure for the disease in the",

Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have borrowed \u00a375k or less.\n\nLet us consider the example of a mortgage of \u00a320k at 5.7% fixed for 30 years, with an average 10% deposit. A 1% rise will increase the rate by 0.25%, and if we assume a 1% rise costs the lender 2p, in the first year this will eat into some of the interest received, but after 1 year it only costs 1p - and the benefit will be in the later rate discount.

This has helped cause it to keep interest rates at historically low levels. Given the rate rises that the Bank has been predicting recently \u2013 0.5% for 2015 and 2016 \u2013 a rise of 0.25 should help",

This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive. A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one. A more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one. But there is growing evidence that more girls and women have the condition than was originally thought and that it is being significantly under-diagnosed. We met Millie at home in Norfolk.

            "The claim you hear most often about the energy market is it's somehow rigged in favour of the big energy companies. There's never been any evidence to support this claim, but the latest news from the energy regulator Ofgem suggests the market is being rigged in favour of the big energy companies.\nThe latest figures from Ofgem show the average annual dual fuel bill has risen by \u00a31.50 to \u00a31,132. The rise is despite the fact that energy prices have fallen in real terms over the last five years. In fact, prices fell so much that on average households are now paying 8% less for energy than they did five years ago. This is despite the fact that the Government has pumped around \u00a31bn into the energy prices charged to households and businesses. This is because the cost that has to be covered by the energy companies (and those companies' shareholders) has risen faster than the cost consumers have to pay to get the energy. Even worse,"

I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nLoading Senator McCain is currently battling brain cancer and is receiving treatment.
