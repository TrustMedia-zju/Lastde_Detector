At some point there had to be a benefit so what could it be? Historically, design and shape of shoes have often been influenced by fashion trends rather than ergonomic factors. Narrow shoes have long been associated with an aesthetic of elegance and refinement. In many cultures, slim and pointed footwear was considered fashionable and symbolic of a higher social status. This trend likely spurred the production of narrower shoes to meet societal expectations and preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the manufacturing process of shoes can play a role. Narrower shoes can be less expensive to produce because they require less material and can be simpler to design and assemble than wider, more ergonomically shaped footwear. This economic benefit may have encouraged manufacturers to lean towards slimmer designs.\n\nHowever, the prolonged wearing of narrow shoes can indeed lead to negative alterations in foot structure such as bunions, hammertoes and other orthopedic problems. Awareness of these health implications has grown, and there is now a greater demand for shoes that fit well and support natural foot anatomy. As consumer preferences shift towards comfort and health, the footwear industry is adapting, focusing increasingly on ergonomics in shoe design alongside style.", "sampled_crit": 1.5200331211090088}, {"original": "If we use alcohol as disinfectant, why drinking it doesnt solve throat infection / sore throat? Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral accumulation on the surface, it's usually lymph nodes swelling in response to chemicals released by the infection as your body takes action to fight the infection. - if it does kill anything it will be surface level membranes and cells. - the alcohol needs to be pretty strong and it still needs time to take effect. - just about anything can kill bacteria and viruses pretty easily....

Many reasons contribute to this. First, a throat infection isn't necessarily bacterial, but it can also be viral, such as the common cold or flu, against which alcohol is ineffective. Drinking alcohol does not maintain a high enough concentration in the throat area long enough to effectively kill bacteria. The alcohol used in disinfectants is typically isopropyl alcohol, which is not safe for ingestion, while the alcohol consumed in beverages is ethanol, which is diluted in drinks and is not present at concentrations high enough to have a significant antibacterial effect.\n\nMoreover, consuming alcohol can actually weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection. Alcohol can also dehydrate the body; hydration is crucial for the recovery and maintenance of health during illness. Alcohol may provide a temporary numbing effect on the sore throat due to its sedative properties, but this does not address the underlying infection or inflammation and could potentially worsen the symptoms once the numbing wears off.\n\nTherefore, while alcohol serves as a surface disinfectant well, it does not effectively or safely function as a treatment for throat infections when ingested.", "sampled_crit": 0.5577740669250488}, {"original": "The lower your resting heart rate, the better. True? Why? There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake himself up during the night so he can exercise to get his heart rate up again. Otherwise, he could die in his sleep. EDIT: AI fact check: The story you might be thinking of is about Marco Pantani, a legendary Italian cyclist who had severe bradycardia. While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night. While there are reports of him occasionally using a stationary bike at night to manage his condition, it wasn't a regular practice. In fact, he preferred training outdoors during the day. Here are some key points to clarify: Pantani's bradycardia was a medical condition, not typical for all cyclists. Most cyclists, while having lower resting heart rates than average, wouldn't experience such extreme bradycardia. He didn't use an alarm specifically for nighttime exercise.

A pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake him if his heart rate falls in his sleep too low. Does this mean that a very low resting heart rate is always a sign of good health?\n\nThe lower your resting heart life, the better. True? Well, not necessarily. While a lower resting heart rate can be a sign of excellent cardiovascular fitness, especially in athletes like professional cyclists, it is not a definitive indicator of better health for everyone. Athletes often train intensely to improve their heart muscle strength, which can result in a lower resting heart rate because their hearts pump a larger volume of blood with each beat, requiring fewer beats per minute to maintain a steady flow.\n\nHowever, extremely low resting heart rates, particularly under 40 beats per minute can sometimes indicate problems such as bradycardia, a condition where the heart does not pump enough oxygen-rich blood around the body. Symptoms of bradycardia include fatigue, dizziness and fainting spells.

Great question! Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva. You know that feeling of your mouth watering when you look at/smell something delicious? That's the first stage of digestion preparing itself for the work ahead.

When we eat, the food is broken down into various components, including carbohydrates. In the stomach, carbohydrates are partially digested but there is no significant absorption of glucose. The digestion process primarily serves to prepare food for absorption in the small intestine by converting it into a semi-liquid form called chyme.\n\nAs chyme enters the small intestine, carbohydrates are broken down into simpler sugars like glucose through the action of enzymes. The small intestinal tract is highly efficient at absorbing glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream and leads to an increase in blood sugar levels. This absorption begins quite soon after the food consumption, not necessarily several hours later. The presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the pancreas to release insulin which helps cells absorb glucose and use it for energy throughout the body.\n\nMoreover, the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream can vary based on the type of carbohydrates consumed.

They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain.

Why do fish always orient themselves upright (with their backs to the sky and belly to the ocean floor) while living in a 3D, weightless environment like water?\n\nIn water, fish always orient themselves upright primarily due to their biological adaptation for balance and survival. A key feature contributing to this orientation is the swim bladder, an internal gas-filled organ that helps regulate buoyancy. By adjusting the amount of gas in the swim bladder, fish can not only maintain their depth, but also their upright position in water. This organ allows them to conserve energy by stabilizing their position without constant swimming.\n\nMoreover, the positioning of fish\u2019s eyes and mouth structures is optimized for feeding and predator evasion when they maintain an upright orientation. Their dorsal (top) and ventral (bottom) sides are colored and patterned differently in a phenomenon known as countershading which helps in camouflaging themselves from predators above and below them in the water column.\n\nThe inner ear of the fish also plays a critical role in their ability to orient themselves. It contains tiny crystals and sensory hairs that detect gravity and motion, aiding them in determining their position relative to the gravitational pull.

In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues.

In diving, decompression illness includes several different conditions, mainly decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism, both of which can be fatal. Decompression sickness, often known as the \"Wave\" occurs when divers ascend too quickly. During a rapid ascent, the decrease in pressure causes nitrogen to come out of solution and form bubbles in the bloodstream and tissues that has been dissolved in the blood at higher pressures at depth. These bubbles can cause joint pain, paralysis and damage to the nervous system, potentially leading to death if critical areas such as the spinal cord or the brain are affected.\n\nArterial gas embolism, another form of decompression disease, can occur if a diver holds their breath while ascending. This can cause the lungs to over-expand and rupture, allowing air bubbles to enter the arterial circulation and block blood flow to vital organs including the brain and heart, leading to immediate life-threatening situations.\n\nBoth conditions require prompt medical treatment, typically in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber that helps dissolve the bubbles and restore normal circulation.

The hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively.

Asbestos fibers are extremely small and can easily become airborne; once inhaled they can penetrate deep into lung tissue. Unlike fiberglass, which tends to break down and clear more easily from the body, asbestos fibers are more durable and resistant to the body's natural clearance processes. This allows them to remain in the lungs or pleural tissues for many years.\n\nOnce lodged in the lung tissue, asbestos fibers can cause several serious health problems.

If your plants live in a well drained sand/silt/clay mixture, you can water as much as you want and the plant will never ever rot. Water has oxygen in it when it rains or we water, so there has to be something in the soil to use up that oxygen to kill the roots.

As long as the roots have access to sufficient oxygen, water propagation can be a successful method. Typically, when propagating, only a portion of the plant (often a cut stem or leaf) is placed in water, allowing it to develop roots. This method is effective because the water provides a constant moisture source directly to areas that need it, without the risk of fungal diseases often associated with soil due to overwatering.\n\nHowever, overwatering plants in soil can be detrimental because it leads to a lack of oxygen in the root zone. When the soil is too wet, air pockets are filled with water, reducing oxygen available to the roots. This lack of oxygen can cause the roots to suffocate, decay and eventually die, which harms the whole plant. Additionally, overly moist soil conditions can promote the growth of root rot pathogens, which can further damage the plant. In contrast, in water propagation, the plant is frequently monitored and water can be changed frequently to ensure that it remains clean and oxygenated, thus promoting healthy root growth without the diseases associated with excess water in soil environments.", "sampled_crit": 0.9209719896316528}, {"original": "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species?

Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density.

This feeling, sometimes referred to as \"butterflies\" is caused by the rapid changes in forces exerted on your body, especially due to the effects of gravity and acceleration.\n\nWhen the ride suddenly accelerates or decelerates, your body experiences shifts between positive and negative g forces. As the coaster car plunges downwards, your body tends to move downwards at the previous speed due to inertia, even though the coaster car itself is accelerating downward faster. This creates a sensation of weightlessness or reduced gravity. Your stomach and other internal organs, which are loosely suspended in your abdominal cavity, float up relative to the rest of your body, stimulating the nerves in your stomach lining and creating that fluttery, tingling feeling.\n\nMoreover, this response is not purely physical; there is also a psychological component.

This principle is based on the idea that if there is a deviation in the ratio, for example, more males than females, then females will have a higher reproductive value due to their scarcity. Consequently, parents genetically inclined to produce females will have a greater chance of having a larger number of grandchildren, thereby passing on more of their genes. Over time, this selective advantage leads to a restoration of the 1:1 ratio. Conversely, if there are more females than males then producing males becomes more advantageous.

For instance, Titanosaurs had extremely light, air-filled bones which reduced the overall body weight while maintaining structural strength. Furthermore, the configuration of their limbs, being more columnar and directly under the body, provided more efficient support for a massive body compared to the sprawling limbs of some large reptiles or the angled limbs of elephants.\n\nThe environment during the Mesozoic era, when dinosaurs thrived, was also conducive to the evolution of large body sizes. Higher oxygen levels and extensive vegetation provided the necessary resources for sustaining large herbivores. This abundance of food allowed herbivorous dinosaurs to reach and sustain their massive sizes, which in turn influenced the size of the beasts.", "sampled_crit": 1.8211500644683838}, {"original": "Why is water essential for life on other planets?

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the maternal mortality rate in the United States has significantly increased from the year 2000 onwards. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend. There has been a rise in chronic health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which complicate pregnancy and childbirth. These conditions are more prevalent in the United States compared to decades past, partly due to changes in lifestyle and an aging maternal population, where more women are giving birth over the age of 35.\n\nAdditionally, disparities in healthcare access and quality play a crucial role. Women from minority groups, particularly African-American women, experience higher rates of maternal mortality due to factors including systemic racism, socioeconomic disparities and less access to adequate prenatal care. These issues are compounded by a lack of standardized care across healthcare facilities and a shortage of healthcare providers who specialize in maternal and reproductive health.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the variation in how maternal mortality data are collected and reported. Differences in state-level reporting standards and practices can obscure the true scope of the problem, leading to underestimation of the crisis and delays in effectively addressing it.\n\nOverall, the increase is substantial", "sampled_crit": 1.9361947774887085}, {"original": "Why does the human body jerk/shock itself awake sometimes while trying to sleep?

The exact cause of hypnotic jerks is not fully understood, but they are considered a normal part of the falling asleep process and are generally not a cause for concern unless they frequently disrupt sleep.\n\nSeveral theories suggest why hypnotic jerks occur. One popular theory is that they are a natural part of the downtime process of the nervous system that occurs during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. As the body relaxes, muscles can twitch involuntarily. Another theory suggests that these jerks are an evolutionary relic.

Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose.

Normally, the body has a protective mechanism to prevent such incidents.

You can. It is just not sensible to do so. Medically-induced comas involve sedating a patient to a point where they are completely unconscious for an extended period of time. This form of coma is typically reserved for serious medical conditions that cannot be managed by other means, such as life-threatening brain injuries or infections. Although entering such a state might technically circumvent the immediate discomfort of withdrawal symptoms, the risks and complications associated with medically-induced comas are significant. These include pneumonia, blood clots and muscle weakness. It does not address the underlying issues of addiction such as psychological dependency and behavioral patterns.\n\nEffective treatment for withdrawal involves medically supervised detoxification that is safer and aims to manage symptoms as the body adjusts to functioning without the substance. Healthcare providers can offer medications to relieve withdrawal symptoms, coupled with support for psychological needs. This approach not only helps manage physical symptoms safely, but also addresses the root causes of addiction through therapy and support programs, paving the way for long-term recovery.

Insects are small, lightweight and have bodies structured to withstand impacts in proportion to their size. When a human slaps an insect, the force transmitted is not uniformly distributed across the body of the insect due to its small size and relatively large surface area of a human hand.

This exoskeleton can absorb and dissipate energy more effectively than one might intuitively expect. The insect's light nature also plays a crucial role.

Marathon runners often experience the \"wall\" \u2013 a point where their bodies have depleted glycogen reserves, causing a significant drop in energy and performance.\n\nLastly, prolonged physical exertion without adequate physical exercise is unavoidable", "sampled_crit": 2.403418779373169}, {"original": "how do athletes play in 0\u00b0 with skin showing?

Only when the body can\u2019t produce enough heat to counteract the cold environment, which athletes actively manage, get frostbite. When athletes play in temperatures around 0\u00b0 Celsius (32\u00b0 Fahrenheit) with exposed parts of their skin, they rely on several physiological and strategic methods to maintain body heat and performance. During intense physical activity the body generates significant heat through metabolic processes. Muscles working hard produce heat as a byproduct of energy expenditure which helps to keep the body warm even in cold conditions.\n\nMoreover, athletes often use specialized gear and clothing designed to retain body heat while still allowing mobility and sweat evaporation. This might include compression garments that help to maintain muscle temperature without completely covering it. Layering also plays a crucial role \u2013 athletes can wear breathable yet insulating layers that they can remove or add depending on their warmth needs and the intensity of their activity.\n\nAs part of their training, many athletes acclimatize themselves to colder temperatures, which can improve their physiological responses to cold, including improved blood circulation to the extremities and increased metabolic rate.

The human foot is a biomechanical marvel, equipped with a unique structure that includes arches, bones, muscles and fat pads, all of which distribute and mitigate pressure efficiently.\n\nThe arches of the feet play a crucial role in this process. They function like natural shock absorbers, flattening under body weight to spread the pressure over a wider area, thus reducing the force at any single point. This design prevents excessive compression of the blood vessels within the feet. The soft tissues and fat pads in the feet also help cushion and protect vascular structures from being pinched by the weight of the body.\n\nMoreover, blood vessels themselves are quite resilient structures designed to withstand various pressures. Like those elsewhere in the body, the arteries in the feet are surrounded by smooth muscle that can constrict or dilate to regulate blood flow.

Your body can generate energy to fuel your muscles in different ways. At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy. This chemical that glycogen combines with is called lactate and it's the reason why your muscles start to burn when you start working out with a lot of intensity. Once you adjust to higher intensities, your body produces less lactate (it's a byproduct of generating energy without oxygen) and your muscles can work at a higher intensity without \"burning\".

The adaptations in our bodies are extensive and vital for increasing endurance. First, the heart muscle strengthens, enabling it to pump more blood per beat. This increased stroke volume delivers more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles and effectively removes carbon dioxide and other waste materials. Additionally, the total volume of blood increases in the body, further enhancing cardiovascular capacity.\n\nThe muscles also undergo significant changes. The number of capillaries, the small blood vessels within the muscle tissues, increases, improving the delivery of oxygen and the removal of waste products. The muscles' ability to utilize oxygen also improves due to an increase in mitochondrial density. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell where energy production occurs and having more of them means that the muscles can produce more energy aerobically.\n\nFurthermore, regular cardio training leads to an increase in the production of enzymes involved in the aerobic energy pathway.

Question: If you get an injury underwater (say in the ocean) that opens the skin and bleeds, what stops your body from taking water?\n\nAnswer: If you get an injury underwater (say in the ocean) that opens the skin and bleeds, several physiological mechanisms prevent water from entering your body through the wound. The human skin, even when injured, does not absorb water readily, because it is made up of multiple layers designed to protect internal organs and prevent the entry of foreign substances. When the skin is cut, the body immediately responds to seal the injury. Blood clotting is the first defense, where platelets (a type of blood cell) aggregate at the site of injury to form a clot. This clot acts as a barrier, not only stopping the bleeding but also preventing external substances, including water, from entering the bloodstream.\n\nThe pressure exerted by the internal fluids of the body is generally higher than the surrounding water pressure, which helps to keep water from being forced into the wound.
