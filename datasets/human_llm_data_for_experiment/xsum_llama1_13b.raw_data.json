West Sussex County Council (WSCC) agreed plans with families on Friday. Gina Chirico, victim Mark Trussler's fiancee, said: \"We're more than happy.\" Shelley Spooner, a friend of Matt Jones who died in the disaster, said the temporary memorial would be a steel arch and people would be able to tie ribbons to it. The Shoreham toll bridge became the focus of commemorations for the people who died when a 1950s Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August.

Theresa May defended the government's plans to expand Heathrow during PMQs. The prime minister told MPs the scheme could meet air pollution standards. She was responding to a question from Tania Mathias, one of the Conservative MPs fighting the third runway. The government's long-awaited backing for a third runway at London Heathrow has also been attacked by cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Justine Greening and sparked the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith.

Others offered suggestions for where might be good to attack next, leading the Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Steve Kavanagh to say he would consider arresting Twitter users who appeared to incite violence. But some experts fear the extent to which technology is to blame may have been overstated.

Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans.

        "The quantity of goods bought rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was stronger growth than economists had been expecting. The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes. That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks. \"A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,\" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year.

        "The three firms will collaborate on the systems needed to make cars that can navigate without any help from a human driver. The vehicles will be capable of driving safely along major roads as well as in suburban and inner city areas. BMW said it hoped the collaboration would mean it could put robot cars into production by 2021. The research partnership was announced on the day when US officials begin an investigation into a fatal car crash involving a Tesla Model S, to which self-driving technology could have contributed. BMW said the trio would develop computer and sensor systems that gradually reduce the part humans play in driving a car. Ultimately, it said, it hoped to produce vehicles that could operate entirely autonomously without any people onboard. Achieving this, said BMW, would make it possible for fleets of unmanned vehicles to operate safely. This, it added, could spur the creation of novel ride-sharing services in urban areas or lead",

Householders are protected from prosecution as long as they act \"honestly and instinctively\" in the heat of the moment. \"Fine judgements\" over the level of force used are not expected, says the Crown Prosecution Service. What this means in practice is that someone can claim they attacked in self-defence if they genuinely believed they were in peril - even if in hindsight they were clearly wrong. Victims do not have to wait to be attacked if they are in their home and fear for themselves or others.

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries.

Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon.
