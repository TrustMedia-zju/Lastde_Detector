        "For almost 15 years, a group of players has met every week, rain or shine, to play Dungeons and Dragons. They are just now starting to become as famous as their heroes, and are hoping to make it bigger still.\n\nThe group, called The Fellowship of the Ring, is part of an official group on Facebook that connects fans of the epic fantasy, which is in the process of rolling out movie versions of its first three movies. With the news that a movie version of The Hobbit is in the works, Tolkien fans have been on a roll.\n\nOver the course of several years, as the group has grown from a group of about six to about 700, it has become a meeting place for fans of the books in their own world as much as in the world of Middle-earth: The Fellowship of the Ring was where the group\u2019s main organizer first came up with the idea of getting a group together to play D&D. The group has even established",
        "After suffering amnesia, you go on a quest to discover your past. It is a much darker tale than you once thought. Light. Dark. Depressing. Thrilling. Romantic. Humorous. It's a story the likes of which you've never seen or read before.\n\n*\n\nA dark fantasy epic.\n\nAn erotic romance tale.\n\nA lighthearted romantic comedy.\n\n*\n\nThe story follows a young man, who as a child was subjected to a mysterious, traumatic event, which leaves him amnesic. As he struggles to remember his past, and get his life back on track, he will face his demons one by one, and discover the truth about himself.\n\nThis is not, as some may think, just another manga/anime/video game about being the hero. With the story I have, there is much more at stake than a high adventure story.",
        "You wake up one day to find that everyone acts differently. Rudeness is considered polite while politeness is considered rude. Wake up in the morning feeling your cheeks flushed. If you are a man you wake up with a huge erection. What has gone wrong? Is it something you did?\nWhen that realization hits me I usually just wake up and go to the bathroom, get an erection, then just go back to bed. What's the big deal?\nBut I can't stop thinking about whether its from something I did or something I did not. Then I usually wonder if it still is a big deal. It is really not a big deal. However, I always get the nagging sense that something must be done about it.",

        "Another murder case where once again all evidence points to the squirrels. Speaking conceptually, if any living thing must die, any living thing can kill, how is it that the squirrels are always the victims here?\n\nSquirrels do not have any special powers; they do not have any special skills; they are not the most diabolical creatures that have ever lived. They are just animals. They don\u2019t even have opposable thumbs. All animals are prey, and all prey are eventually food.\n\nIf squirrels really were evil, as it appears they often are, then why are they not more commonly blamed for the deaths of humans? Surely the death of some stupid, old man is the real crime here, not the death of one innocent animal, and how many other innocent animals have been murdered by people?\n\nI guess the reason squirrels die in the most dramatic and obvious ways is because we have all these elaborate stories in our minds.",

A +6 might not let you give them a huge skill, but it would let them start with more tools of their trade. But it certainly wouldn't give them +6 in 5 different things.\nThere's no reason why you couldn't have, say, +6 dexterity while remaining physically average, unless you decided that your genetic designer babies came in a large number of colors.",
