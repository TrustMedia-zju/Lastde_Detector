        "What has caused maternal mortality to rise so dramatically in the US since 2000? To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, compared to other developed countries, has a substantially higher infant mortality rate. This is a meta study, so looked accross methodologies of many different studies, and while the exact number (obviously) varied, the result was the same - looking at IMR, we are on par with Croatia, not the UK, Canada or Australia. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856058/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856058/) Despite a pretty complete analysis, this data didn't really get at a single cause. For instance, income disparity only accounts for 30% fo the gap in infant mortality compared to Finland. So, while that is a chunk of the explanation (we have great healthcare, but only if you are that has it AND can afford it). To be fair - I think this may have been obfuscated by some low income jobs having better insurance. One thing",

This starts temporarily, but eventually causes permanent damage to the capillaries in the face, causing that rosey red look of a heavy drinker. I am an Allergist. This is garbage. Histamine only causes inflammation in the bloodstream and tissue, not GI tract. Histamine is destroyed by acid and pepsinogen in the stomach and diamine oxidase in the intestines long before it can cross over. Histamine release from mast cells already resident in the body can happen. Still, histamine in your food has no effect whatsoever on histamine levels in the bloodstream, unless you have an enzyme deficiency and even then the evidence is pretty inconclusive. This has been proved in MANY trials. Bent RK, Kugler C, Faihs V, Darsow U, Biedermann T, Brockow",
        "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses? When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patrollers. If evaded, the virus starts infecting and multiplying, and it takes a little while for the immune system to notice. When it does though\u2026 it\u2019s war. First the innate system notices and begins to attack. White blood cells eat, spray acid, and rip themselves apart to deploy DNA webs. Macrophages join and attack. Inflammatory processes are activated. Complement proteins flood the area. Natural killer cells execute any cells that don\u2019t look healthy. Debris accumulates, including virus parts. Then dendrites wander in and pick up the virus parts. They then float around the body until they encounter a dormant T cell with just the right receptors. This meeting is a serious one, with a two part confirmation. The lock clicks and then the dendritic cell confirms and twists the activation key. The T Cell turns on ready to do violence, begins rapidly multiplying and makes its way to the",

        "how can insects survive a slap from humans, a creature that's gigantic compared to them A matter of scale. Resistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section. The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*. But area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry. Imagine an ant being the size of an elephant. All its dimensions would be roughly multiplied by something like 500, the strength of its legs by 500^2 = 250,000 but its weight by 500^3 = 125,000,000\u2026 and the poor beast would break down under its own weight.

Mum was thin all her life till she hit 60. In other words she didn't start creating an over abundance of new fat cells till then. Unfortunately this new fat cell creation was post menopause and thus her body distributed it more like a male with most of it going on the belly viscerally. Not yet understanding why she had a more male distribution, but I recognised the danger about 5 years ago when a random YT video appeared in my feed about an autopsy of a 70yo woman from Heart disease and a heart attack. The woman on the slab was the exact shape my mother had become. Scared the life out of me and for the last 5 years I'd been trying to persuade Mum to lose the weight. Unfortunately",

        "why do humans require so many types of food to be healthy when many animals can eat one thing? Humans (and all other things) evolved to minimize their need for THEIR most scarce resource. If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy. A mutation that makes use lose the ability to make vitamin C means we no longer waste that energy. If starvation is more likely to kill us than the lack of vitamin C, shedding",

You probably do not need that much, but that being said it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t benefit from that much if not more. If you are working out hard, in more bodybuilding style workouts looking to gain as much muscle mass possible, this isn\u2019t an unreasonable amount of protein. Or if you\u2019re in a calorie deficit looking to shed fat to reveal as much muscle after a bulk it still is reasonable, as higher protein diets help against losing muscle in a calorie deficit.

I mean, certainly there is an element of metabolism but a lot of fat middle aged people get there because of the financial change. They go from ramen and sparse finances justifying fewer meals to having more money and eating more in a sitting because their control was dictated by their wallet and not their constitution and habits. I also think elderly people tend to be at a point where they made the mistake and slimmed back down. Also more free time usually means more physical activity.

        "Is it possible to see what ethnicity/race someone is just by looking at organs. For starters, race and ethnicity are social constructs. They are arbitrary lines drawn around perceived differences that have been reinforced via social structures. There is little to no genetic, physiological, or physical differentiation between different ethnicities or races that does not partially rely also on social classifications. Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\". Second, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone. The belief that the race of an individual can be determined through physiological clues is called **scientific racism**, **racialism**, or **race realism**.

They're not sitting still: they're playing a football game and doing a lot of rigorous physical activity.

        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose. Notice how this system doesn't leave",

        "Why do some medications say to not consume grapefruit while taking them? Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful",

Harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-splicing system is completely changing the outlook for this type of sickness. CRISPR-Cas9 is an immune system for bacteria. It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body. CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to remove a genetic disease (sickle-cell anemia) from patients, using a custom-designed one-time serum that the doctors injected into the patient. It's a little more complicated than that, but CRISPR is the core of that method. Retroviruses, like HIV, are",

I think the question is why doesn't it get pulled out of us? That is because the rest of our bodies are putting more force holding it in place. Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong. I know some people will say the Iron in your blood isn't magnetic, but the interesting thing is that MRIs make things magnetic because an MRI is two magnets. One makes everything in your body more like a magnet. The other is to change the way they sit so as the relax they give off radio waves. The way",

Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that\u2019s strong enough to allow for incredibly complex chemistry and yet won\u2019t dissolve the molecules that make up the organism. If life is carbon-based, water\u2019s really the only solvent that fits the bill. And while it\u2019s technically possible that there could be life that\u2019s not carbon-based, it\u2019s probably unlikely. This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y\u2019know, live. The way carbon forms strong covalent bonds with itself means it can form molecules like DNA in a way that other atoms just can\u2019t. And even the few elements that can, like silicon, don\u2019t form long chains that",

Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That\u2019s 165 \u00baF / 74 \u00baC.

        "Why is death irreversible? Your tissue is made of cells, which are basically tiny living things. When they die, the things they are made out of start breaking down. That's why the body decomposes. It starts with just some chemical bonds breaking. But also any bacteria that was trying to get in your body stops being impeded by your immune system. So that starts moving in and breaking things down too, leaving behind toxins. We can certainly use machines to make the heart beat and lungs move. That will get your circulatory system running. Through this alone we can keep a person \"alive\" long after brain death. Brain death is the one we can't reverse. Your brain is what keeps things going subconsciously, and it's also what gives you your conscious mind.

Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration. In some unique cases you do have blues, but this is not pigment",
        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They mention that episodic memories usually start around 3-4 years of age. Some people mentioned how memory is linked to language, but this isn't proven. If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones. An episodic memory is basically \"this specific thing happened\". You do however form associative memories. These are more general and are the type that go: \"If I cry, caregiver will give me attention\", \"cat hurts\", \"shape goes into the square hole\".

They are also kind of interlinked. - firstly babies have very large heads (relatively) and they have a straight spine (that gets bent in and out as we age - which is normal).

This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering. If your plants live in a well drained sand/silt/clay mixture, you can water as much as you want and the plant will never ever rot.

There's a combination of reasons. The most significant one is that cheese mold itself usually isn't dangerous. Most varieties of mold that commonly grow on cheese just changd the flavor. They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content. And if you have a hard cheese like cheddar, and it gets wet and then molds, it's also not safe because of the moisture. Then soft cheeses like Brie, you'll get opinions both ways.

What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic. This means your kidneys need to kick into overdrive and filter out the salty blood as quickly as possible by",

We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed.

        "why fish always orient themselves upright (with their backs to the sky, and belly to the ocean floor) while living in a 3d space-like environment. In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the brain. This",

There was no science behind the target of 5 by the way, it was chosen as a nice easy to remember number and obviously eating veg is good for you generally. If you have good kidney function and aren't ill or sweating loads, you don't necessarily need 2 litres of water. Basically the requirements are different person to person.

The thing is, humans are actually pretty hard to infect. We are covered in an ablative layer of keratine that is constantly growing and sluffing off. We have only a few openings in that later to the outside world, and they all have defenses to keep stuff out. This is necessary because the outside world would love to kill you. You are covered in bacteria that would readily devour you if it could only get inside. Your mouth has antiviral agents inside it.

        "shouldn't you always bleed out during surgery? Hemostasis or the stopping of the flow of blood, is managed in a number of ways. As an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination). The band is then left in place to prevent blood form flowing into the leg and thus from bleeding into the surgical site. Another way hemostasis is maintain, is",

The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work. The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work. The square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume grows faster (cubically) than surface (squarly), which also (usually) means that",

        "why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses? Wild horses who can't cope without them die:) But the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet and legs that a wild horse",
        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning? Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to take place. DOMS are not indicative of \"a good workout\" like is",

        "if you get an injury underwater (say in the ocean) that opens the skin and bleeds, what stops your body from intaking water? Your blood pressure is higher than the water pressure. That's basically the short version. When a hole between two liquid containers is made, effectively connecting them, the liquid flowing through that hole will be from the higher pressure container to the lower pressure container. In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container. Incidentally this effect is also behind why when the city water supply has been shut off for a while, then turned back on, the water always comes out of your faucet a bit discolored (yellow or brown) until you let it run for a while. And you're usually told not to drink it until you've left it on for a while to flush water through the system. There are always leaks in a city's main water pipes at the joins",

Now lets look at heat produced. The adult's 100 kg body is built and shaped proportional to the 25 kg kid. * Kids have a higher surface area / mass ratio. They lose heat faster than adults. This means that **kids burn more energy for producing heat.** Lets look at behaviour. Yesterday I sat at work for an extended time. Healthy kids probably moved around more than me.

They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around",

Those receptors help your brain and body know you\u2019re tired. When you block them with caffeine, you just feel more awake while the caffeine is working. Cocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors. So you get a build up of dopamine in the synapse and it amplifies the effects of the dopamine. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so addictive- you\u2019re getting like huge hits of dopamine (which is a natural brain chemical) but in a super unnatural way.

It would be more apt to say that sinuses protect the lungs indirectly though mucus, if one's pushing that point across. Second, going by the logic that sinuses trap harmful substances/organisms, one might come to a conclusion that we'd better off without having sinuses at all\u2014solely because of the existence of various types of cancer affecting that part of the body.

In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently.

Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths.

But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap.

YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander.

The liver's primary job is to make compounds in your blood take on a form that's easier for the kidneys to excrete; in practice this means making them more soluble in water. All in all the liver is about making things you want more available to you, and making wastes easier to excrete. The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and the stomach, it's the first pass which tries to balance everything in a way that works for your body. The liver breaks down large molecules into smaller and more easily absorbed ones as well, it does a LOT of different things really. The liver is",

An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb.",

There are a couple of reasons for the \"gut\". It's normally not that large a layer of fat, their cores are absolutely packed with muscle to stabilise them through the lifts they do, with a healthy layer of fat over the top.

        "Why does alcohol make stress and depression \"go away\" almost instantly but is making it worse in the long run? There are multiple factors involved in this, but it comes down to neurotransmitter deficits, particularly your GABA system, and something called glutamate rebound. Searching for alcohol, gaba, and glutamate on YouTube will probably find a better video than I could explain. In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you\u2019re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good. Over time, the problem is that the body stops producing that which it is having supplemented, so, if your neurotransmitters were already out of balance, then the alcohol makes it worse by",

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it\u2019s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don\u2019t the bladder will push against a close valve, and this pressure will rise",

You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. Secondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%). Nearly all SIDS cases present with at least one of the above risk factors, excluding bed-sharing. Additionally, groups get conflated - babies which are bottle fed at night often",

Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart.

The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet)",

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid",

        "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses? When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patheons with which humans for some reason do not normally fight very well. In fact there are no known strains of viruses which are specific to our species or any other. With these viruses we have to rely on our own innate immune defenses to fight them, without any particular knowledge of the new agent. But when more than one strain is present, the virus then has the opportunity to learn from one to another and start adapting better defenses against them-and maybe even developing new ways to infect us. This process is known as recombination.\n\nThere is another important aspect to viruses. They are very efficient at changing the genes of their host. Each type of virus carries a few specific genes which carry out its particular task.

A simple Google search will reveal a lot of studies that link poor health to meat.\n\"Poor health to meat\". I don't see the connection but perhaps that's because vegetarian diets are so lacking in variety.

It's not relevant to my comment.\n> Vegans are missing out on important nutrients   > Please don't bother me",
        "Why do we need so much protein? Like everything in fitness, this is either an reasonable or unreasonable amount of protein depending on your goal and personal circumstances. Some people are happy getting by with less, and some people need it to grow. Personally I don't find it that easy to get too much protein. I had a few instances of the shakes going a bit overboard recently (3 scoops to 2 scoops with some coconut oil) but for the most part I have it down to an art.\n\nFor example my normal shake is 400 calories, 80g of protein, 35g of carbs and 19g of fat. The protein is around 20% which is a good amount for growing and a little bit is needed to recover properly from sessions, and the rest are carbs where I aim for about 30g and it's a fairly low carb drink.\n\nIf you just look at the protein it's obviously not that high.

I think the best way to deal with these problems is to understand the factors which motivate a person to store excess body weight and the forces which cause this to occur....\n\nThe reason a person puts on weight is usually a combination of factors. The most obvious and common cause is consuming too many calories. However, there are factors such as stress and depression that cause a person to take in fewer calories, and in some cases to actually have trouble with overeating. We therefore need to understand why people overeat.\n\nWhen we talk about a hormone, the word itself actually refers to a collection of chemical compounds. There are various kinds of hormones, each being expressed in different parts of the body. For example, the hormones released by the pituitary gland cause the cells of the brain to produce special chemicals. These chemicals stimulate the central nervous system, which then send signals",

        "Why the elderly body odor is so strong? As a person ages the body naturally slows down. This includes all parts of the body. Whereas a young child or teen has a fast metabolism, which means their body is using oxygen rich blood to fuel the body cells\u2019 activities, in seniors the blood contains less oxygen so the body requires more time to use the oxygen to fuel its activities. When blood can hold less oxygen, even less oxygen can be transported to the body cells thus slowing them all down and making them weaker and prone to more wear out. The weak cells are more likely to be exposed to environmental odors as opposed to the healthy cells. Even with the weakened immune system of older adults the body reacts slower to odors thus increasing the chance of the body\u2019s reaction to odors. The other reason is that as they age their body\u2019s ability to produce sweat decreases, thus they don\u2019t produce as much odor neutralizing chemicals (NOACs).",

        "Why can't things be sterilized by time? Well, it depends on the pathogen in question. Most viral particles quickly become non-viable, so they can't be transmitted once time has passed. Viruses that need a host to survive, like the flu, aren't affected by time because their hosts are continually replicating, so they don't pass on their viruses once time has passed.\n\nBut the influenza virus, which is a common cause of viral illness, can evolve to become resistant to time. While influenza and some other viruses are usually benign, they pose the risk of severe disease if they infect people who are weakened by age, previous infection, or disease\u2014which is a particular problem for the elderly. If the flu virus begins to survive for decades, it won't only become more dangerous to its hosts; it may also be able to infect people whom they couldn't infect before.\n\nSome viruses, particularly the ones that infect plants in crop fields to spread",

What about an average woman and kid?

What you will feel or experience in your sinuses is not any different from any other spot on your face or in your respiratory system. All of the airflow is regulated via a complex network of muscles and bones. If the sinuses didn\u2019t have some function, they would all fuse together. That is not what happens. A lot of people confuse the role of the sinuses with the function of the nose. The nose is used to bring air in contact with the mucous lining of your airways.

Humans, and other warm-blooded animals, have a thick layer of liquid surrounding their body known as an extracellular fluid. This layer allows our cells to communicate with each other on a chemical level and allows our body to regulate its temperature.\n\nThis layer doesn't exist in bacteria and in fact it actually helps them to stay alive and helps them to grow. Scientists are currently trying to figure out how to prevent this growth.\n\nHow copper is used as an antibacterial agent\n\nBacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria (which includes staphylococci, streptococci, and a number of other bacteria), can be affected by a number of different substances such as copper ions. This is because copper is able to directly bind to certain proteins in bacteria making it impossible for the bacteria to bind to their cell wall. This means that",

        "why different drinks (wine, beer, vodka, scotch, etc) have different hangover effect on people? Isn't alcohol molecule the same?\nWell, the alcohol concentration might be the same, but different drinks contain different amounts of sugar, other components which affect the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream, different amounts of sugar, different amounts of water, different amounts of other chemicals, etc. It's very hard to generalize like that - it depends what you drink. If you drink whiskey and cola, it will definitely feel different from just drinking whiskey.\nHow about whisky and orange juice?  Does it also feel different?\nNot really, though if you drink straight whisky then the orange juice might help you get to sleep (it's the sugar, I think). But alcohol doesn't affect sleep directly - if you aren't too hungover the next morning then you might find it easier to fall asleep.",
        "How do doctors treat severe over-hydration (like the famous water drinking contest)? Doc here. TLDR- fix it in a reasonable time or they die and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but their own.\n> it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but their own.   What's their problem with dehydration? I'm pretty sure if they don't drink water they'll die.  Like there's no middle ground. They'd die by staying awake.    I'm sure it happens in practice, but that doesn't sound right.\nWell it\u2019s no secret that people die all the time from dehydration and the reason is not because they just can\u2019t drink more water, but because they don\u2019t drink enough. I don\u2019t know the medical terms but I\u2019m sure you can dig online for the correct explanation of what I mean.",
        "Doctor told me the amount of bacteria in a probiotic doesn't matter much, because they will quickly multiply inside the gut anyway. So why take them?   Also, what about food dyes and such?\nBacteria is very complex, there are many types of bacteria some good and bad, some harmful. Probiotics are bacteria that assist in digesting food and fight off other bacterial infections. Food, specifically fruits/vegetables, are sources of bacteria so this doesn't really make sense at all\n>  Food, specifically fruits/vegetables, are sources of bacteria   not really a source of bacteria, a source of their symbiosis, which is different :)",
        "Why covering extremities in our bodies (especially our **feet for example, by wearing socks**) is so essential to warm our bodies. This is only useful in our case because our body temperature is low enough. But what about that animals that live in the arctic. They need to cover extremities to survive. What's up with that?\nFoot hair insulates much better than skin and does not burn. I imagine covering the rest of your body would save energy.\nDoes it really though? I could see a thin layer of hair perhaps but if you start covering your legs and chest it seems like it'd start to become a huge negative force when it comes to insulation. Why our feet and our extremities?",
        "If rabies needs direct contact to spread, and also kills its host within a few weeks, then how is it not \"extinct\" yet?\nVaccination has made some parts of the world immune to rabies. It hasn't infected people in years. Some countries use live vaccine, where you bite into a piece of meat and let the animal bite in. Other countries use killed vaccine and the animal has to be killed, usually by lethal injection, before it can spread the disease\nI'm sure there are some people who aren't interested in vaccination or the laws in their country regarding what they eat.   There must be some human rabies cases that have happened in the recent world history.\nIt's only a matter of time before a bunch of countries realize that vaccinating livestock is better in the long run for their publics, and stop importing unvaccinated animals. Then hopefully one day there will be no more human rabies cases in the world.  Or",
        "- How does co sleeping cause SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)? So where I am, it is specifically advised for parents to sleep with their little ones. (It is actually the law here to put the child in the same crib even if they share the room.) SIDS has gone down since it was implemented.\n\nThere is no good evidence for or against co sleeping. Some people do get up with them often during the night, but that doesn't appear to make SIDS any more likely. It may make it less likely that you will wake up and notice if there is trouble, although I am not sure that happens any more with infants over 6 months old. Some babies prefer having their parents nearby for comfort, others not. Most parents who co-sleep have done it for generations.\n\n- When can I stop co sleeping?\nOnce the baby understands how to regulate their own temperatures you can gradually move away from the baby sleeping in bed with you. I have",
        "Why are Dolphins specifically friendly towards humans only and not towards other animals/fish like sharks? Dolphins - like humans - are highly social and communicative beings. They have a complex language. So why does the Dolphin have such a strong reaction to sharks?\n\nCould there be an evolutionary reason? Has the shark threat ever existed? When Dolphins and humans first diverged. Dolphins probably were in the same family/order. The shark threat was never prevalent. So dolphins evolved without the \"shark avoidance\" reaction. Sharks have been around for 400 millions years. Dolphins for 100 millions years. How do these fish species even find each other to mate? Did dolphins evolve to communicate with the sharks because both of them have a fear of the unknown?\n\nBut what if the threat never existed in the past? What if the shark threat was just invented? Could evolution happen in less than 50,000 years? Would dolphins have to be conditioned because there weren't any sharks in the past? Or",
        "why you never hear about the human heart getting cancer, are there other organs that don\u2019t get cancer? The heart muscle itself, not the valves or the cells around it, is what is responsible for pumping oxygen through the body. And it gets damaged by this, so it\u2019s natural for it to give cancer.   also what organs don\u2019t get cancer\nIve never heard of any other body part (besides eyes because your lenses dont really have a blood vessel supply, and they probably regenerate) getting cancer.\nSkin and bones do get cancer. Most of the time, it does not spread, so it is not very dangerous, but it can become deadly in worst cases. Skin tumours are also very common. Bones can also grow cancerous spots too.  And yes, eyes are probably the only non-tumourous eye structure in the body. I don't think they actually regenerate. Some people born with cancer go blind early",
        "What happens to your body when you participate in a marathon Long distance running problems/risks (and the things you describe) in no particular order Cephalalgia, Myalgias, Bruising Muscle and joint pain (fractures) Shin splints, Stress fractures, Stress related injury, Ligament and tendon injuries, Muscle strain and strain injuries. This section highlights some issues which you can help address before running a marathon and some issues which may occur afterwards, whether you are a first-time marathoner or an experienced marathoner We would also like to emphasise that we are not qualified physiotherapists, we are simply members of the public who have taken up running and who had the good fortune to be able to put our knowledge to the test during the training for and running of many marathons. I can't say I ever had an issue with any pain because I had already prepared my body and mind for the events. The following are some of the running injuries",
        "Why aren\u2019t our bodies adapting to our more sedentary lifestyles by reducing appetites? Because evolution doesn't work that quickly. So this idea about getting used to it and then the desire diminishing over time isn't true. We are very much still at a peak in terms of food demand because our bodies are adapting more slowly than is necessary.\nI didn\u2019t expect to get a serious answer here. I was poking at how ridiculous the idea is.\nI know! I wasn\u2019t even being that serious about it though, just giving a plausible (and possibly true) reason why we still feel that compulsion.\nI was just making a joke because I remember making the same argument. It\u2019s always a good chuckle to do it.",
        "How does an alcohol overdose kill you? Hi there. simply put, you have two chemicals that either speed your brain and body up, or slow it down. alcohol slows it down, and al-pro-b is a speed up. you dont get high, you pass out, and can't wake up.  please drink responsibly people\nThere are ways to make alcohol kill you..\ni was saying how it cannot happen naturally except through stupid drinking games, or if a body has too much in it.\nHow do you not have a heart attack with the amount of alcohol you have in your body?\ni didnt say you wouldnt die from alcohol poisoning. i just said it isnt normally how it works.",
        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is nitrogen toxicity.\n> nitrogen toxicity  That seems like it would be the worst type of it tbh. I remember reading a while back that the majority of the time it does, if I remember right it's a build up of a harmful gas that's being created as you digest the food you ate.\nyeah, it kinda is. Usually the symptoms that would lead to you getting decompression illness, i.e. headache, loss of focus, etc, are also symptoms of nitrogen toxicity. For those who get nitrogen toxicity quickly, just one or a couple hours can mean death.\nI'm curious: if he was trying to be a little more healthy by fasting (or cutting calories for whatever reason) would that have taken the toll on him that much earlier that it would have been different?",
        "Why is eating an orange better for your blood sugar than drinking orange juice? >when you eat an orange, doesn\u2019t it pretty much do a sugar rush in seconds? So why is this better than orange juice, if it\u2019s quicker, not as filling, and more expensive?  Why not look into the science behind it?\nBecause the placebo effect is powerful.\nBut the placebo effect isn't based on the reality of the action being beneficial, it's based on the reality of the action being a different perceived form of beneficial. The question is, why does the action being perceived as beneficial create this effect, even though the action isn't actually beneficial?  You seem to be answering about why the action appears to be beneficial, not why that phenomenon exists at all.",
        "Why do cheeses get aged for years but 1 week in a fridge and it gets moldy? Precisely that. France here. As a cheese, aged 7 years.\nI've heard that as the cheese ages the moisture level decreases, which allows better mold growth.\nThat's not how mold works. It thrives in warm and dry conditions. When you store it in a cold environment it will be fine for however long you hold it. The \"moisture increase\" does make it more pliable and elastic. Some cheeses will break the mold as they age. But mold can grow on all manner of things that are not moist.",
        "why cotton mouth can damage your teeth Dentist here long answer incoming. Perio is highly complex. It\u2019s not just that there is swelling of the teeth, but there is underlying cause too. Cotton mouth can cause dehydration. You can read a lot about this. But bottom line is you shouldn\u2019t smoke cannabis if you have inflammation of gums, enamel is important, it prevents oral bacteria from seeping into the mouth.\nWhat would cause the perio to become more susceptible to infection?\nThe more susceptible factor is perio, we are talking about the long term here, over time it develops more prone to infection, this depends on many factors. So it takes time for perio to develop or more prone. So we need to be on this track consistently.",
        "Why have zebras never been utilized as cavalry animals? Eli5: Horses grew up with wolves and bears, which you can run away from or kick. Zebras are not domesticated to the point of having those instincts removed.\nI am not sure Zebras have enough endurance for Cavalry duties.\nthey're more suited for light cavalry i'd say\nNo they are not  And you are wrong for thinking what you do\nwhy the fuck are you going around assuming i'm wrong and why are you telling me what i think, you dont even know me  Zebras are built more like camels, they weigh more and are shorter and skinnier. Horses and mules are basically giant cats with hooves, which is why i said they were better suited for light cavalry like donkeys and ostriches.",
        "When someone gets pregnant while on birth control and then continues taking it daily until realizing they are pregnant, how does this not harm the fetus? Are these hormones not harmful to fetuses?\nIt\u2019s still an unplanned pregnancy. The risks are no different than a non-smoker drinking alcohol.  I would be more concerned about the potential long-term effects of taking a progesterone pill than the hormonal contraceptives in use today.\n>I would be more concerned about the potential long-term effects of taking a progesterone pill than the hormonal contraceptives in use today.  Can you expand on this?   Just curious.\nThere are some hormone replacements out there that are supposed to mitigate the effects of PCOS. They've never shown conclusive data that it's a good alternative to the birth control pill, but it certainly has a strong placebo effect. That's the real danger -- someone trying to keep their pcos in check might take one of these and end",
        "Why do humans have to \"learn\" to swim? I don't think this is very true. Dogs, cats, and a lot of other animals have a natural instinct to swim, even if they never had the chance to learn as infants. Do we as humans only have the natural instinct to swim if we spend significant time in pools?\nDogs learn to swim just fine, but they're not going to jump off the dock the first time.  Human infants may *have* a natural instinct to swim, but we need to learn to get out of the way of oncoming traffic or drown."
