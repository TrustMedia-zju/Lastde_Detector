You have been wearing the garish green costume for the entire day and your armpits now carry a sharp stench. But your next break is in an hour, so you look forward towards the line of children with an artificial smile. It must be nice to be Santa Claus, since they get to sit down. The next kid is blonde, around 5 years old? He is adorable, but you're too tired to be affected. It's obvious that his parents put a lot of effort into making him look like a china doll.

He thinks of space, of the vast, magnificent emptiness of it all, and he smiles. His teacher is rapping on his desk, \"Please Alfie, pay attention.\" Alfie sits in his bedroom, his LEGO in hand, and he creates marvels; imposing castles, graceful skyscrapers, vehicles of all types. His favorites are rockets. His mother knocks on the door, \"Alfie, why don't you play with the other boys?\" Al sits in his cockpit, with nothing but the blue sky before him. He streaks through the air like a falcon. Up here its quiet, open and vast. His radio cuts in, \"Lt. Col Ward, we have a bogey...\" Al sits on the launchpad, strapped in to his seat.

I've always had a sort of irrational fear of flying, being thousands of meters in the air and not knowing whether or not my plane would have the minuscule chance of becoming just another crash statistic. My eyes met with the stranger's, his were a sky blue and his hair black like oil and slicked back. He wore a rather swanky business suit. His tie was blood red along with his matching handkerchief, protruding out his front jacket pocket. His legs were calmly crossed and he leaned in ever so slightly. \"I said the plane will crash\" he whispered. I could see the neatness of his pencil mustache, probably just recently trimmed. His breath had the distinct odor of peppermint and vodka. \"What?\" I managed to whimper, clearly shaken by what",

They were a hardy and adaptable race that had been waging war on themselves for millennia. They entertained themselves with battle so it was a perfect fit. The other races were not informed by the Eldar Council of this decision. The tenuous peace pacts had to be preserved but they felt this security force would handle the unrest well.
