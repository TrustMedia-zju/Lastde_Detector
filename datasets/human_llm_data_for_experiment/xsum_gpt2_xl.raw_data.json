        "The finance committee is investigating the \u00a31bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan book. Earlier this month, businessman Gareth Graham accused Frank Cushnahan of trying to ruin his family's business. But Mr Cushnahan has now issued a lengthy rebuttal of Mr Graham's claims. In a letter sent on his behalf by a solicitor, he states that he \"achieved a maximisation of value\" for the SP Graham Group that he advised for three years. Mr Cushnahan's letter also deals with tapes made of his phone calls and allegations that he had a conflict of interest. Mr Graham told the committee's inquiry that Mr Cushnahan was conflicted in his Nama role because he retained shareholdings in some Graham property companies that were moved into Nama, effectively a \"bad bank\" responsible for recovering the value of problematic loans made by other Irish banks. But Mr Cushnahan said",

The footage showed the president shaking hands with fellow worshippers. Aides say Mr Buhari has been resting after receiving medical treatment in London for an undisclosed illness. Earlier this week, the president missed his third cabinet meeting in a row, stoking further debate about his condition. Until Friday, he had not been seen in public for two weeks. Mr Buhari returned from the UK in March after seven weeks of sick leave. When he returned home he said he had never been so ill in his life. Since then he has rarely been seen outside of his official residence. His wife, Aisha, has said that her husband is not as sick as is",

His comments come a week after the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) visited Jamaica to investigate claims that the country's athletes were not being tested rigorously enough. Media playback is not supported on this device Former Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco) executive director Renee Anne Shirley sparked the crisis when she said the agency conducted just one out-of-competition test in the six months leading up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Her criticisms, made in an article in Sports Illustrated, followed a series of adverse findings involving Jamaican track and field athletes. Asafa Powell, the former 100m world record holder, was the biggest name to test positive, but four others, including Powell's training partner Sherone Simpson, the Olympic relay gold medallist, also failed tests at the country's national trials in June. Both Powell and Simpson claim they took supplements that might",

But Faraday Future has faced financial difficulties and one analyst said it had to challenge \"scepticism\" following last year's CES presentation. The FF91 was introduced via a live demo, in which it drove itself around a car park and backed into an empty space. Pre-recorded footage also showed the car accelerating from standstill to 60mph in 2.39 seconds. Tesla's fastest model did it in 2.5 seconds on the same track.

        "What force does the law allow? In England and Wales, anyone can use \"reasonable\" force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. Householders are protected from prosecution as long as they act \"honestly and instinctively\" in the heat of the moment. \"Fine judgements\" over the level of force used are not expected, says the Crown Prosecution Service. What this means in practice is that someone can claim they attacked in self-defence if they genuinely believed they were in peril - even if in hindsight they were clearly wrong. Victims do not have to wait to be attacked if they are in their home and fear for themselves or others. These guidelines also apply if someone, in the spur of the moment, picks up an item to use as a weapon. The law very clearly says that a householder is not",

Furthermore a separatist insurgency in the south-west has not eased, and both the economy and the energy situation have worsened. In May 2011 he had to cope with the fall-out in Pakistan of the killing by US special forces of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad.

The attacks came hours after pro-government forces began an operation to drive the jihadists out of Anbar. On Wednesday, troops and militiamen were said to have taken up positions south of the provincial capital Ramadi. The city was captured two weeks ago after troops withdrew despite vastly outnumbering the IS forces attacking, prompting the US defence secretary to question their \"will to fight\". A source in the Iraqi army's 1st Division told the BBC that 17 of its soldiers were killed in an attack on its headquarters 5km (3 miles) east of Falluja that involved three suicide car bombs. The source added that suicide car bombs and militants wearing explosive vests were also used to attack troops and Shia militiamen north of the town of Karma, also east of Falluja. In both cases, the militants took advantage of a sandstorm that engulfed most of Iraq on Tuesday night",

If central government funding is limited, they argue, the alternative is private finance.

Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon. According to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format. \"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said. \"That, in my view, is a serious mistake.

        "Many growers blame the weak pound which has reduced their workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit, according to a BBC survey. About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU. But the industry believes Brexit is exacerbating the problem and if access to non-UK workers dries up, it could cripple home-grown berry production. Their concern is backed up by an in-depth survey of growers by the BBC. The questionnaire was sent to members of the British Leafy Salad Association and British Summer Fruits, which represent 90% of growers in their sector. There was a big response. Three-quarters",

Mr Pena Cuevas was refused basic German benefits for August and September 2012, as they had spent less than three months in Germany.

The comments represent a departure from the practice usually followed by British prime ministers of avoiding commentary on the merits of contenders in the US presidential race.

It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed. Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up. The invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama.

This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive. A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one. A more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one.

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome. The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral.

Theresa May defended the government's plans to expand Heathrow during PMQs. The prime minister told MPs the scheme could meet air pollution standards. She was responding to a question from Tania Mathias, one of the Conservative MPs fighting the third runway. The government's long-awaited backing for a third runway at London Heathrow has also been attacked by cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Justine Greening and sparked the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith. The decision is also set to face a challenge in the courts, with the Richmond council leader Lord True telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"taking legal advice\". The Conservative peer said Heathrow was \"busting air quality legal limits\" and was responsible for \"40% of all noise pollution in Europe",

A year ago, an investigation in the US found that VW had cheated emissions tests for diesel cars by using special software. VW faces a flood of actions and has set aside \u20ac16.2bn to cover the lawsuits. The court said it brought in extra staff to process the claims submitted by shareholders, who were concerned that 18 September, the day VW's manipulations were uncovered a year ago, may be the deadline to file. It said most of the cases were bundled actions containing claims from multiple plaintiffs, in many cases private investors.

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60%",

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders did not cut their SVRs at a similar pace, leaving many people still paying around 5% a year. Such lenders are unlikely to increase their SVRs until there has been a",
