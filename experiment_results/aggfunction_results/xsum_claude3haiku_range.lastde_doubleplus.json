He added: \"Perhaps 100,000 operations will now have to be cancelled, around a million hospital appointments will have to be postponed, causing worry, distress and anxiety for families up and down the country.\" And he called again for talks with junior doctor representatives to resolve the ongoing dispute.

The unions have argued that the cost-of-living crisis has eroded the real value of their wages, and they are seeking significant pay increases to keep up with inflation.\n\nThe government, on the other hand, has insisted that it cannot afford to meet the unions' demands, citing the need to maintain fiscal discipline and control public spending. This has led to a standoff, with both sides refusing to back down and the prospect of further industrial action looming.\n\nAs the strikes approach, the public is being urged to prepare for disruptions and to seek alternative arrangements where possible.

This suggests that consumers are regaining confidence and are more willing to spend, despite the ongoing challenges posed by inflationary pressures and global economic uncertainties.\n\nAnalysts attribute the better-than-expected performance to factors such as a robust job market, rising wages, and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in many parts of the country. The improved consumer sentiment is seen as a positive sign for the overall economic outlook, as consumer spending accounts for a significant portion of economic activity.\n\nHowever, experts caution that the road ahead may not be entirely smooth, as the threat of a potential recession looms large.

The latest legal opinion from the EU advocate general, Melchior Wathelet, confirmed a similar ruling by the ECJ in November 2014, known as the Dano case. The benefits covered by the Garcia-Nieto case \"must be regarded as social assistance benefits\", not linked to the labour market, Thursday's legal opinion said.
