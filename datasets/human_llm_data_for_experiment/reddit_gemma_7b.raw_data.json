Muscle cramps from a combination of muscle microtears and low electrolytes (sodium and potassium mainly) 4. Low electrolytes from sweating (loss of sodium) and urine concentration (your kidneys want to hold onto water but still get rid of waste, long story short your urine becomes concentrated, which why it\u2019ll be more dark yellow, and you\u2019ll lose potassium to hold onto the sodium you\u2019re already low on), further compounded by the water you drink during the run (no electrolytes in it to replace, what you have becomes",

        "shouldn't you always bleed out during surgery? Hemostasis or the stopping of the flow of blood, is managed in a number of ways. As an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination). The band is then left in place to prevent blood form flowing into the leg and thus from bleeding into the surgical site. Another way hemostasis is maintain, is through Electrosurgery, commonly referred to as bovie. The use of an electromagnetic",

There are some \"wild\" dog species that were domesticated once and somehow branched off alone and",
        "Why do hangovers get worse with age? There could be a lot of factors. A lot of hangovers are intensified by dehydration, so it could be that you are good at hydrating and so you don't really feel the real bad parts of a hangover. I used to never get hangovers, and I would always make sure I drank at least two 16oz waters before bed. I slacked on that and I got hangovers. However, my story turns to me getting into trouble with drinking too much, and then those hangovers got to the point to where I haven't drank in almost a year. Some people are predisposed to handle alcohol better than others, but those are the people that are more at risk for alcoholism. When you see someone that can just drink and drink and be fine, that can be a slippery slope to falling into where it no longer becomes fine. Those people are the ones more prone to blackouts because their body can",
        "If the placebo effect works by tricking the brain, why does it need to be tricked if it's apparently able to solve the issue on its own? The placebo effect is complicated and difficult to study. Unfortunately, it's not possible to make any absolute and certain statements, since this is an area of ongoing medical research. We can only say what seems currently likely. Relatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that \"established\" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean. \"Regression to the mean\", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better. Even if they have a disease that is permanent and the body can't fix it, people have ups and downs within that context; and they tend to be going to get treatment when they're in the \"downs\". There does appear to be some",

Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with. A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during. Spiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses. Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first. That's not to say spiders can't learn, or",

        "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses? When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patrollers. If evaded, the virus starts infecting and multiplying, and it takes a little while for the immune system to notice. When it does though\u2026 it\u2019s war. First the innate system notices and begins to attack. White blood cells eat, spray acid, and rip themselves apart to deploy DNA webs. Macrophages join and attack. Inflammatory processes are activated. Complement proteins flood the area. Natural killer cells execute any cells that don\u2019t look healthy. Debris accumulates, including virus parts. Then dendrites wander in and pick up the virus parts. They then float around the body until they encounter a dormant T cell with just the right receptors. This meeting is a serious one, with a two part confirmation. The lock clicks and then the dendritic cell confirms and twists the activation key. The T Cell turns on ready to do violence, begins rapidly multiplying and makes",

In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the",
        "why do humans require so many types of food to be healthy when many animals can eat one thing? Humans (and all other things) evolved to minimize their need for THEIR most scarce resource. If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy. A mutation",

I used to live in a subdivision with a large golf course and when a friend of mine convinced me to wake up at 5am on Saturdays to go to one of the water hazard holes to go fishing (we were both equally as dumb as we were ambitious), we rode our bikes over to Hole 15, wind screaming across the fishing pole line as we hit like 15mph on the downside of hills, and went for it. We did catch some fish, mainly small ones I can't remember, but the spiney-ass carp are the ones that stuck with me.

        "If your leg gets amputated, how does your body know to not produce enough blood to replace what was lost? The answers so far are crappy. Yes the kidneys regulate blood pressure, and if that drops due to losing blood, they will simply stop producing urine to keep all the water inside the body and dilute the remaining blood to keep the pressure up, so it still goes places. But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin (called epo when talking about doping in sports). They produce more of there\u2019s less oxygen in the bloood. Which happens when the blood is diluted, because you lost blood, and it wS simply filled back up with water. This hormone goes to the bone marrow and causes it to produce more red blood cells. Once",
        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They mention that episodic memories usually start around 3-4 years of age. Some people mentioned how memory is linked to language, but this isn't proven. If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones. An episodic memory is basically \"this specific thing happened\". You do however form associative memories. These are more general and are the type that go: \"If I cry, caregiver will give me attention\", \"cat hurts\", \"shape goes into the square hole\". It also includes language, and you",

You can't clean a person like you can a piece of metal. You can clean 99.9% of the oil off a piece of metal and it is as you would expect, almost entirely free of oil. Skin doesn't work like that. Human skin is filled with glands that produce oil constantly to keep our skin healthy; remember that we are basically bags of slightly salty water, we need a waterproof covering to keep the inside in and the outside out. Furthermore our skin grows from an underlying layer pushing the old layers outward. Your surface skin is dead tissue that",
        "- How does co sleeping cause SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)? So where I am, it is specifically advised for parents to sleep with their infants. No hospital I\u2019ve been at has detached cribs for healthy newborns, they all have co sleeping beds. You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc) From what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. Secondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%). Nearly all SIDS cases present with at least one of the above risk factors, excluding bed-sharing. Additionally, groups get conflated - babies which are bottle fed at night",

ELI5 version: Virus good at hiding, spreads easily, hard to get rid of. Long version: The virus has been around since like written history (or so historians say, there's writings of people exhibiting similar symptoms but it wasn't exactly called rabies then). Bats are huge carriers and a big reason why we cant irradicate in the US, but the UK has done a fairly good job at it and a few other areas I believe? Their teeth are also so small, they don't always leave marks. You get bit or scratched by a carrier and even there's been inhalation of vapors from bat feces apparently that causes initial exposure.

        "Why do we feel hungry, weak, or lightheaded at all, when the body can just burn the stored fat? If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise. But, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still (making you cold/weak/tired) - it might do both, but the homeostasis process is just trying to guard your energy stores. If the food",

Once the baby is born, the placenta, which used to be stuck to the wall of the womb to help get nutrients from mother to baby, will detach and come out of the mother\u2019s body naturally, usually within about 15 minutes. Once it\u2019s detached, the blood flow stops, and it dies like any other organ that\u2019s been cut off, and no longer does anything to help the baby. If left alone, the cord will slowly dry out, but it\u2019s easy to irritate the stump caring for the baby and could cause an infection, think like how you can get an infection by picking the skin around a scab too early, only a baby is a lot more likely to get one.

But tobacco plants can absorb arsenic from the soil as they grow, much like rice, and the arsenic remains in the leaves as they are dried and ends up in the finished product. In its natural state it wouldn't be a problem, but you're consuming a relatively large amount of tobacco leaves since they've been dried and concentrated. Tar is a confusing one, because the \"tar\" they are referring to is not the same as the \"tar\" you may be thinking of, its not the same stuff they put on roads and roofs.

Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing. Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. Humans are specialized in... well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances. Our arms can't easily haul our body weight up a tree or be used for walking, but can accurately throw things, build tools. Once humans started building tools natural selection greatly preferred the most nimble, flexible hands and arms that could make better tools,",
        "Why covering extremities in our bodies (especially our **feet for example, by wearing socks**) is so essential to warm our bodies. This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards. Scientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with multiple layers of clothing, insulating it well.

Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong. I know some people will say the Iron in your blood isn't magnetic, but the interesting thing is that MRIs make things magnetic because an MRI is two magnets. One makes everything in your body more like a magnet. The other is to change the way they sit so as the relax they give off radio waves. The way I tell people to think about it is like",

For example, a person dying from complications from pneumonia, diarrheal disease or HIV/AIDS (infections), cancer, stroke or heart disease (internal body malfunctions), or sudden organ failure would most likely be listed as having died from natural causes. \"Death by natural causes\" is sometimes used as a euphemism for \"dying of old age\", which is considered problematic as a cause of death (as opposed to a specific age-related disease); there are also many non-age-related causes of \"natural\" death, for legal manner-of-death purposes.

That's why the body decomposes. It starts with just some chemical bonds breaking. But also any bacteria that was trying to get in your body stops being impeded by your immune system. So that starts moving in and breaking things down too, leaving behind toxins. We can certainly use machines to make the heart beat and lungs move. That will get your circulatory system running. Through this alone we can keep a person \"alive\" long after brain death. Brain death is the one we can't reverse. Your brain is what keeps things going subconsciously, and it's also what gives you your conscious mind. We don't have a way to kickstart that again because we still know basically nothing about how it works. It's kind of like the heart/lungs",

There are quite a well stacked medical cabinets on the space station with various drugs and devices that might be needed.

They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment",

        "How and why can some metals like copper be antibacterial? It is important to remember that bacteria and cells aren't like us. Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage. Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth. The second big thing to remember is that all living things are essentially just chemical processes. You put two molecules next to each other and things start to happen.

Humans didn\u2019t evolve to have a litter or two a year and raise their young to be fully independent in a few months. We evolved to have just a few babies over our whole life. Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. This is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains. They need to be born kind of underdeveloped for survival because otherwise their heads would be so big that it would be too dangerous for the mother to give birth to them. Because babies are born not fully developed, instead of having lots of instincts already set up",

Most sea animals - fish, cephalopods (like octopus and squid) and sharks aren't social at all, and most aren't intelligent. They have either no interest or no capacity to interact with anyone - in the case of fish, dolphins likely just see them as food, in the same way most of us view a chicken. The only other intelligent, social animals a dolphin is likely to ever meet is other ceteceans (whales and dolphins) and humans. Whales are social, intelligent animals, but aren't quite as smart as humans or dolphins.

There are a couple of reasons for the \"gut\".

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it\u2019s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don\u2019t the bladder will push against a close valve, and this pressure will rise and can damage the seals leading to",

It's important to understand that fluoride already occurs naturally in many sources of drinking water. In fact, in some places, the natural mineral water contains significantly *more* fluoride than is recommended to reduce tooth decay, and the excess is removed. Basically, the recommended levels of fluoridation are known to be generally beneficial, and are known not to be harmful, and are well within the bounds of what might be found in nature anyway, and the fluoride is cheap and fluoridation is easy.

You probably do not need that much, but that being said it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t benefit from that much if not more. If you are working out hard, in more bodybuilding style workouts looking to gain as much muscle mass possible, this isn\u2019t an unreasonable amount of protein.

Cocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors.

An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. Women's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a shorter gait and wider hips.

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed. It passes through much quicker and everything in it will be absorbed much quicker. This can lead to a rapid rise of",

The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and the stomach, it's the first pass which tries to balance everything in a way that works for your body.

Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration. In some unique cases you do have blues, but this is not pigment but structural actually. The structure of the",

There are multiple factors involved in this, but it comes down to neurotransmitter deficits, particularly your GABA system, and something called glutamate rebound. Searching for alcohol, gaba, and glutamate on YouTube will probably find a better video than I could explain. In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you\u2019re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good. Over time, the problem is that the body stops producing that which it is having supplemented, so, if your neurotransmitters were already out of balance, then the alcohol makes it worse by giving your body another source of making this happen, so",

It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right atrium of the heart. You can also develop chemodectomas (tumors of special sensory cells) in the aortic body (which I guess is",

(Like dentist office billboard advertisement levels of white teeth) Stains aren't the same thing as plaque or dirt. Staining is in the tooth like dye on cloth, not on the tooth like paint on a wall. One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel. Teeth need to be whitened with something that can oxygenate the enamel and allow the bleaching effect to take place.

These formulas open the enamel \"pores\" to oxygen,",

        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose.

The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet) for at least 3 minutes.

Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density.

Harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-splicing system is completely changing the outlook for this type of sickness. CRISPR-Cas9 is an immune system for bacteria. It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body. CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to remove a genetic disease (sickle-cell anemia) from patients, using a custom-designed one-time serum that the doctors injected into the patient. It's a little more complicated than that, but CRISPR is the core of that method. Retroviruses, like HIV, are insidious because they splice themselves into your body's cells and become part of you.

Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to take",

Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\". Second, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone.

Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.)

The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful molecules, for example, converting",
        "How come dinosaurs like the titanosaur grow to such large size, when animals like the elephant cant grow larger due to the square cube law? The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work. The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work. The square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume",
        "Why do we take medicine to suppress symptoms like coughing, fever, etc. when those are our bodies way of fighting infection? Internal medicine physician here. Fever is not always bad. If not associated with any pain and not severe, you don\u2019t require anti-pyretics. People just do it because it makes them feel like they\u2019re doing something sometimes. We also know now that the fever isn\u2019t needed for most infections. Your body also has an extremely complex immune system. Fever is part of the primitive response. Primitive response reacts first while the more complex processes ramp up. Macrophages start devouring viruses and bacteria and present pieces of them to T cells. T cells then bind to plasma cells when ramp up their production. It also provides the plasma cell the information it needs to produce antibodies. Antibodies are secreted and attach to the viruses and bacteria. Once they are, \u201ctagged,\u201d the immune system swarms these cells and kills them rapidly. This can take 10-14 days usually.

        "Why does diarrhea-causing food expedite defecation? Reposting this classic explanation from u/jiggity_gee So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis. When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).",

A good nursing home can help this but without being able to get any help from the patient it becomes an impossible task to take care of them. A small infection for example which could be deadly for a senior citizen without medical attention might go unnoticed for days if the patient is not able to complain about pains. Even leaving a seriously ill Alzheimer patient unattended for a few minutes at night could cause you to miss them jumping on their bed falling over and braking bones, which for seniors could be fatal as their body does not heal the same way as adults. But even with the best of care Alzheimers is still deadly on its own. The disease is destroying the nerve cells so the patients start losing neural function one by one. It does start",

There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake himself up during the night so he can exercise to get his heart rate up again. Otherwise, he could die in his sleep. EDIT: AI fact check: The story you might be thinking of is about Marco Pantani, a legendary Italian cyclist who had severe bradycardia. While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night. While there are reports of him occasionally using a stationary bike at night to manage his condition, it wasn't a regular practice. In fact, he preferred training outdoors during the day. Here are some key points to clarify: Pantani's bradycardia was a",
        "why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses? Wild horses who can't cope without them die:) But the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet and legs that a wild horse would only experience",

Mum was thin all her life till she hit 60. In other words she didn't start creating an over abundance of new fat cells till then. Unfortunately this new fat cell creation was post menopause and thus her body distributed it more like a male with most of it going on the belly viscerally. Not yet understanding why she had a more male distribution, but I recognised the danger about 5 years ago when a random YT video appeared in my feed about an autopsy of a 70yo woman from Heart disease and a heart attack.

Resistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section. The forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*. But area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry.

In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container.

Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That\u2019s 165 \u00baF / 74 \u00baC. The appearance and texture will be different due to the difference in myoglobin and fat content. The higher fat content in duck meat makes it juicier and more moist compared to chicken. The higher myoglobin content will make it look more like what we associate with medium rare from steaks. The chance of chickens carrying food borne pathogens like Salmonella is higher than that of ducks because of how chickens are farmed compared to ducks. Much more extensively and in more crowded",

Second, going by the logic that sinuses trap harmful substances/organisms, one might come to a conclusion that we'd better off without having sinuses at all\u2014solely because of the existence of various types of cancer affecting that part of the body.

        "Why does our body start deteriorating once we grow old? Why can't our cells just newly replicate themselves again? Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer. However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure. The narrowing can also affect the electrical activity causing the heart to become more prone to arrhythmia. If a coronary artery is completely blocked,",

Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference.

YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander.

A lot of pathogenic bacteria will, too. But some can survive in the environment without a host, or can ensporulate (basically dry up and form an impermeable coating that preserves dormant genes and cell machinery). * One particularly nasty example of spore-forming bacteria would be [C. botulinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum), the bacterium responsible for botulism. * Botulinum toxin is ounce-for-ounce one of the deadliest biological agents we know of. * C. botulinum is a common soil bacterium that gets on random surfaces all the time. It *typically* only produces toxin when it's active and reproducing/living in an anaerobic environment (like a jar of honey, or a jar of green beans that didn't get hot enough to kill the spores during canning and doesn't have enough salt or acid to inhibit bacterial reproduction). * Another spore-former would be the dreaded [C. difficile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridioides_difficile),",
        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic. This means your kidneys need to kick into overdrive and filter out the salty blood as quickly as possible by just dumping out large amounts of water carrying the salt away. This process is also",

It's better for those oxygen atoms than being by themselves, but they *really* want some extra electrons, and are basically fighting to gain possession of the other atom's. There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it. One big strong oxygen can take care of a single molecular hydrogen too. Its a pretty great set up for both of them. So when molecular hydrogen and oxygen get to hanging out, it tends to be pretty explosive. Molecular hydrogen, however, is pretty rare here on earth--its often tied up with",

When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again.

The thinking is if anyone in the species had a mutation that would result in more offspring of one gender, that would make the other gender have a greater chances of finding a mate and make having children of that gender preferable to pass on your genese. Whenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender. So like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle.

Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed.

Carbs are what diabetics count, not actual sugar. That's why sugar free candy will raise your blood sugar, because they have carbs. Often like 2/3 the amount of carbs of normal sugar candy so those candies arent safe either. They keytones are what kills us when we neglect our blood sugar, they turn our blood acid and shut down our kidneys.

After the placenta is separated from the uterus and the baby is completely separated from the umbilical cord, it is discarded. It may be more curious than the placenta, but it is the placenta, not the baby, that the umbilical cord does not cut, so the baby is born even if the umbilical cord does not cut.

MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and it uses strong magnetic fields to create detailed images of the inside of the body. During an MRI scan, the patient is placed inside a large, cylindrical machine that creates a powerful magnetic field. This magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body to align themselves in a specific direction. Once the atoms are aligned, a radio frequency pulse is sent into the body, which causes the atoms to shift slightly from their original position. As the atoms shift back into place, they release energy in the form of radio waves. These radio waves are detected by the MRI machine and used to create a detailed image of the inside of the body.",

The reason being is that your body needs to relax first so as to prevent any strain when trying to move and when you move you have to flex and extend at the same time as your muscles relax.\n\nThe reason you get a sore back is b/c you did not do either of those. You stretched either but not both at the same time. So you would move too quickly and thus place strain on your lower back muscles because they were either",
        "Refrigerate after opening, but not before? You're right about most dairy products being only pasteurized except for UHT milk in those box containers that last for months on the shelf, but this does not relate to the yogurt in question, just to the milk. Yogurt can be pasteurized or <em>not</em> pasteurized. The yogurt that is being manufactured in the last few years seems to be coming from un-pasteurized whole cream milk. There are several places in NYC where you cannot buy real yogurt like this anymore, not because of rules but because it costs to much for the store to insure itself against selling a product that can have a rare listeria scare. This is why you have to find the real good stuff if you can. The store I'm talking about is called Balducci's, and the yogurt is called \"Chobani\", it's Greek and it's made in New York.

        "Why does blood sugar spike after a meal if food is digested in the stomach for several hours before it starts getting absorbed in the small intestine? Great question: Let\u2019s explore.\n\nThe first phase of digestion is in the mouth, where the enzyme amylase acts in the saliva to begin breaking down carbohydrates. From there, undigested solids reach the stomach.\n\nThe stomach takes 1-3 hours to empty solids. Liquids? Just 20-60 minutes. But it\u2019s not just the type of food, but the amount.\n\nDuring digestion, the solid foods take a while to break down into the liquids needed to be absorbed. Since digestion is not complete in the small intestine, more blood circulation is needed to take the digested solids to the liver for further processing (this is where the blood sugar spikes).\n\nI\u2019m going to explain this in-depth in my upcoming ebook.

        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time, which is now called the humoral theory. According to the humoral theory, humans have four different fluids which were responsible for physical and mental conditions. The four fluids were referred <em>to as humors:</em> <em>blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile</em>. The fluids were believed to be constantly changing, which could result in a variety of illnesses. To restore the correct balance, bloodletting or leeching was a common treatment option. Bloodletting was believed to restore the proper balance of the four humors. It was also believed that bloodletting was a means of treating imbalances stemming from demonic possession and that the removal of the blood will also remove the demons. This is why leeches and snakes were an integral part of early medicine.",

        "why cotton mouth can damage your teeth Dentist here long answer incoming. Perio is highly complex. It\u2019s not just that there is bacteria, it\u2019s that there are different types of bacteria, and certain types produce biofilm, while others produce a lot of acid. These will react with the teeth differently at different locations and at different times\n\nAnswer:\n\nStep 1/2\nFirst, let's define \"cotton mouth.\" Cotton mouth is a sensation that occurs when oral moisture levels are reduced, causing the mouth to feel dry and parched. This can happen for various reasons, such as dehydration, medications, or certain medical conditions. Now, let's consider how cotton mouth can damage your teeth. One of the main reasons is that when your mouth is dry, the natural flow of saliva is reduced. Saliva plays a crucial role in protecting your teeth from decay and infection. It helps to neutralize the pH level in your mouth, wash away food particles and bacteria, and lubric",
        "How and why can some metals like copper be antibacterial? It is important to remember that bacteria and cells aren't like us. Humans, and other animals aren't killed by metal contamination - most often metal is essential to us. This means that we have developed ways to cope with metal contamination to help us live.  What we have is a mechanism for metal tolerance. The only problem is that metal contamination, i.e. copper, stops some bacteria from functioning.  \n\n<h2>The problem with copper?</h2>\n\nThere are more than 9,000 bacteria species in the gut all playing important roles in digestion and other aspects of our health. These bacteria can't cope with the presence of copper so they must be 'killed' by the metal or expelled in one way or an other. Many will die, while other will be expelled and the survivors will try to grow back. This back growth usually takes 3-4 days but this is why you often feel worse",
        "Why did humans get stuck with periods while other mammals didn't? It\u2019s because we are always fertile, instead of coming into heat a couple times a year like most mammals do. We also aren\u2019t born fully mature sexually like other mammals. We have to grow up. The reason we\u2019re more like that is that we eat plants and fruit, which are less seasonal.\n\nSome people believe it\u2019s bad luck to start knitting your own baby socks right away. You see, socks aren\u2019t meant to be done for a baby so it\u2019s said you\u2019re bad luck to start right away. The superstition is thought to come from the fact that no baby socks have been made yet so you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s never been done. That means you\u2019ll definitely fail.

        "Why are Dolphins specifically friendly towards humans only and not towards other animals/fish like sharks? Dolphins - like humans - are highly social and communicative animals who depend on each other for things, like when a dolphin is injured the others will take care of it. This has inspired movies and made us appreciate marine life even more - but the question remains: Why are dolphins so friendly?\n\nOne can make an argument that it is simply just how our minds work: Since we're such intelligent creatures we find ourselves to be the 'apex' of the hierarchy of species and our brains are so developed we can comprehend the emotions and behavior of others. However dolphins have smaller brains and less complex neural connections and this is not a likely reason. They live in large pods of 3-15 members and these pods will be 20-30 individuals. They can understand the feelings of their fellow pod members and can even recognize their cries. Dolphin pods have a leader or hierarchy of who gives who",

A person\u2019s airways include the epiglottis that covers the trachea (windpipe) while the person is swallowing. Swallowing takes up to eight different sets of muscles to work in sequence to get the food down into the stomach. If the food misses the stomach and hits the trachea, it does, in fact, go down the wrong pipe.\n\nThe stomach is a strong acid-filled organ. When saliva mixes with the stomach contents, it is turned into an acid which irritates the airways and can cause inflammation. This can cause coughing and choking.\n\nHere are some tips to help prevent this unfortunate circumstance:\n\n* Do not talk while eating or chewing\n* Do not swallow without breathing in between bites\n* Do not try to force it down, it will likely get stuck\n* Do not try to make",

        "Why do men have bigger feet in contrast to women? Why aren't their average foot sizes equal? An important note is that in addition to the bigger foot size, men also have wider feet than women.\n\nThese anatomical differences can play a big role in their choice of shoes and affect the types of shoes that they have to get. The width of feet can cause many foot health related problems and make certain types of shoes like flip flops hard to get.\n\nFor men, their feet are almost a full size bigger than the average for women. This means that a woman who wears a size 9 shoe, while she is the average for women, a man who is the average (9 \u00bd) will have a 2 \u00bd difference in their foot size. This foot size difference can be attributed to hormonal differences in men and women, as well as the effect that this has on foot growth.\n\nIn men, their feet continue to have significant growth for a longer period of time in comparison",

When you eat an orange, the majority of the fiber in the fruit will bypass the small intestine and travel to the large intestine, where it will not be absorbed and will provide bulk and support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.\n\nStep 2/3\n1. During the process of digestion, most of the nutrients in the orange are broken down into smaller molecules such as glucose and amino acids, which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestine. This means that eating an orange will result in a slower, more sustained release of glucose into the bloodstream, compared to drinking orange juice.\n\nStep 3/3\n4. The fiber content of an orange also helps to slow down the absorption of glucose, as it takes longer to break down the",

        "Why does alcohol make stress and depression \"go away\" almost instantly but is making it worse in the long run? There are multiple factors involved in this problem. The first being the fact that alcohol can release feel good neurotransmitters(dopamine, serotonin) at high levels. In the beginning, this might feel like a natural high, but it is in our nature for our brains to develop tolerance to this chemical state. When the brain develops tolerance, more alcohol needs to be consumed to keep these feel good levels. This leads to the start of a vicious cycle. The second factor involved is the effect the initial release of these neurotransmitters might have on the brain pathways. If someone has a strong reaction to the release these feel-good chemicals, the likelihood of them being able to give these neurotransmitters away again in the long run is extremely low. The combination of these factors makes it very difficult to stop once you start drinking alcohol. As you can see, it is not as simple as \"",

I think the best way to understand this question is to imagine the body, as it were, is some kind of an industrial facility, with some very specific requirements. Like any industrial facility, the body has certain functions it needs to perform. The raw materials it needs to process are the foods we provide. It needs these raw materials to build new tissue, but it also needs them on the job site, for the body to repair itself as needed. The food-processing system we are all familiar with operates by a very simple formula: In. Out. The body needs to process raw materials. As these become available, it uses them to build new tissue. When you eat more raw materials than you need, the body stores the excess in the form of fat. When you eat even more raw materials, the body stores fat in higher and higher amounts. And so on.

Horses do not need to get on a treadmill to burn off calories. I think the answer to that is the human obsession with being in the company of our fellow human beings. While we are capable of running for 50 or even 100, the human brain is really good at thinking when it is at a crawl. When we are running at a fast pace, we are thinking in a different mode \u2013 the emotional mode \u2013 which is very close to the animal brain.\n\nThe human mind in general is very busy.

        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning? Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common symptom of exercise. It is characterized by a painful, swollen, stiff feeling in the working muscles and can usually be traced back to high-intensity exercise. A study by scientists from the Faculty of Kinesiology found that DOMS is not solely caused by strenuous exercise, but also by other factors such as muscle fatigue and exercise duration. \n\n<strong>The importance of exercise intensity</strong>\n\nThe researchers, whose work was recently published in the <em>American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology</em>, measured skeletal muscle glycogen levels three hours and two days after low and high-intensity exercise. Their measurements showed a significant depletion of muscle glycogen levels after high-intensity exercise, while the glycogen levels dropped only slightly after low-intensity exercise.\n\nThe study also revealed that fatigue and exercise duration can affect DOMS",

        "Why does diarrhea-causing food expedite defecation? Reposting this classic explanation from u/jiggity_gee So your bowels are like a train. Water in the colon will move a certain amount within a certain time frame and will keep doing so until the poop is no more. Food passes through the esophagus and then moves to the stomach. When you chew food you release a bunch of saliva and enzymes that break down the food. By this point water is already starting to be absorbed in the mouth and is being transported to the mouth via the mucous/digestive membrane. The food then is pushed down to the stomach and is stored there until sufficient gastric juices/hydrochloric acid can be produced to facilitate complete digestion to small molecules. This is called peristalsis. Once the stomach is happy, it will open up to the small intestine. The food then moves onto this where absorption of fats occurs via a lymphatic. Water is absorbed into the bloodstream by osmosis. This is when it moves back",

Many of the comments are focusing on the fact that cells have a limited lifespan and how our cells could just get new DNA and replicate themselves. This idea is nice but if you ever had to program a cell, you would see that many of the \"programming\" steps have to be done in parallel to ensure that the program is not interrupted. A long sequence would take a very long time before it reaches the end and therefore any error during this process might potentially lead to catastrophic results. The best way to avoid that would be to have a system that can be programmed (replicated) quickly, that has backup systems (i.e. DNA repair mechanisms) and that stops before reaching any critical point.

        "if a morbidly obese person suddenly stopped eating anything, and only drank water, would all the fat get burnt before this person eventually dies from starvation?\nI would assume that all body fat is converted into energy for the body. And when the body has enough energy and can produce enough energy, there would be no need for food. You would probably die of something other than starvation while your body attempts to convert all the fat to energy. I think that eventually the body will run out of reserves and will die. I think the issue would be converting all the fat, it might take awhile to get it all.\nI don't think so. The body must break down carbohydrates to produce the necessary energy to run the systems and perform various other bodily processes. Fats take more energy and time to break down into digestible forms, plus fat is not necessarily the best energy source to use to run the more metabolically expensive processes (as in the brain).\n\nYou could probably find an accurate answer",

One method for dissemination is <b>aerosol</b>, which means to move as a very small solid or liquid particle in the air.

        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however, it's the right salinity, which is different from the wrong salinity of salty water. The salinity of our blood allows us to retain water in our cells, by making the concentration of the salts in our blood higher than the salts contained in our food and water. This water is not able to diffuse out of our blood. This is known as 'osmosis.' When drinking salty water there is too much salt in the water that is greater than the salt concentration inside our body. The salty water does enter and stay inside our blood vessels, however, the high rate of salt in the water causes the water to diffuse out into our body, as more water can diffuse out than can return in. The water leaving our body is called 'dehydration.'\n\nIn hospitals, IV saline drips are used to rehydrate people who have lost a lot of",

In water, an oxygen molecule readily forms and reverts to two oxygen atoms each with a charge of -.\n\nAnswer:\n\nStep 1/2\n1. How do the gills of a fish extract oxygen? When a fish breathes, water enters its mouth and passes over its gills. The gills are composed of many thin, flat sheets of tissue called lamellae. Each lamella has a large surface area, which allows for efficient gas exchange between the water and the fish's bloodstream. On the outside of each lamella is a layer of blood vessels, and on the inside is a layer of gill filaments. The gill filaments are covered in tiny hairs called gill rakers, which help to trap food particles. The blood vessels on the outside of the lamellae are connected to the fish's circulatory system.

Thank you!\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe changes that occur in our bodies when we improve our cardio are not fully understood, but there are some theories. One theory is that when we run, our muscles use more oxygen than they do at rest, so we need\nto consume more food to provide enough energy. This extra food causes our bodies to produce more waste products, which are stored in our cells as fat. As we improve our cardio, these waste products are expelled from our bodies more quickly.",
        "why different drinks (wine, beer, vodka, scotch, etc) have different hangover effect on people? Isn't alcohol molecule the same on all drinks? Thanks\n\nAnswer:\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the hangover effect will vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual's weight, diet, and level of alcohol consumption. However, some general principles about alcohol metabolism can be helpful in understanding why different drinks may have different hangover effects. First, alcohol is metabolized by the liver, so people who have a history of liver disease or are taking medications that decrease the liver's ability to process alcohol may have a more severe hangover. Second, alcohol is converted into acetaldehyde by the body, which can be toxic when consumed in large amounts. For example, people who drink heavily every day may experience a greater risk of developing liver disease or cancer.\nFinally, different types of alcohol can also have different effects on",

For example, if the common cold enters a human body, it attacks a virus, such as a herpes virus, which is more dangerous than it. When a cold enters the body, it releases a chemical that attacks the virus, like killing bacteria and viruses.

Over-potting will have the same affect, albeit on a larger scale which is what brings us to the original question.\n\nSo, can you be over-potting while also being 'pot bound' and if so, how is that possible? Pot bound plants have limited soil, while plants with proper drainage can spread and stretch without restriction. This means that the drainage system plays a large part in this discussion.\n\n<h4>Pot Bound Plants</h4>\n\nSoil is vital to plants as they are able to reach the water and nutrients they require via the soil.\n\nWhen a plant reaches the point of",

I am confused why we stopped getting taller.\nNot 100% sure if this is the best place to post this, but I feel like some people on here will know a lot more than a typical group of people. So I need some info regarding these pictures. Basically they were my grandfathers who passed away last year but the pics are from the 1930s and I want to share some of the pictures with his grandchildren but need information on exactly where the pics were taken. My grandfather wasn't good at remembering details but what he did remember is that they lived near/outside of Prague or was visiting some friends near Prague (Czech Republic). The first pic I'm pretty sure was taken either in the city or somewhere near it where as the 2nd pic was supposedly taken somewhere",

        "So we need calories to survive. If there are 100 calories in a spoon of oil, how come we can't survive on just eating oil? Is it the same for other foods we know with many calories with the idea that they have other nutrients required for survival?\n\nAnswer:  \n\nStep 1/3\nFirst, it's important to understand that calories are a unit of energy, not a nutrient. So, all foods, even ones with low calories, have some value in terms of providing energy to our bodies. Now, let's consider why we can't survive on just oil. One reason is that oil is mostly made up of fat, which is a source of energy but not a source of other nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and protein that are essential for our survival.\n\nStep 2/3\nAdditionally, a diet that is too high in fat can lead to health problems like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nStep",

        "yellow is considered a primary color, but our eyes detect red, blue and green. Is it \"just\" because of how we name things? Also, why are there so many \"wrong\" colors: black (and grey?), brown, navy blue, purple, magenta, orange... but all the other colors are right? Is it just about naming, or is something fundamentally wrong with these colors in a theoretical sense?. The question came to me when i realized that when trying to get my own skin tone from an image, i got a strange color (i thought it needed be a combination of blue, green and red). The first \"right\" answer I got was \"black\", which i immediately ruled out since i know it's just the total absence of light.
