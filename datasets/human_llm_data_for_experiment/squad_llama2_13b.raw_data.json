        "Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers.

The State Education Law, passed in 1953, established five types of schools: state secular, state religious, ultra orthodox, communal settlement schools, and Arab schools. The public secular is the largest school group, and is attended by the majority of Jewish and non-Arab pupils in Israel. Most Arabs send their children to schools where Arabic is the language of instruction. Education is compulsory in Israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen.

This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would",

        "The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century, with compositions by Josquin des Prez. The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass",

Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth.

As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood",

In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned.

However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception.

Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17,",

At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz.

Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be \"precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.\" Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans",

Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network.

The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign.

During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory.",

The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area.

Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Each group had six escort carriers, with a total of more than 500 planes, and seven or eight destroyers or destroyer escorts (DE). Kinkaid still believed that Lee's force was guarding the north, so the Japanese had the element of surprise when they attacked Taffy 3 at 06:45.

        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an",

A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\".

There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately.

Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority.

A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining",

Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions.

        "A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens",

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important",

With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics).

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability",

Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival.

US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000.

As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These",

In addition, young parents have high and conflicting expectations for their children - often to be \"the best\" and to have unlimited time, energy and resources available to the child at the same time.\nAs the teenager becomes more independent, the parent-child relationship shifts. The parent's role is more that of a consultant, coach and a source of information than a primary care giver. This means that the parent needs to change as well as the adolescent.

If the history we have recounted is correct, and species have appeared suddenly in the past, there need not be a present correlation between similarities of flora or fauna in separate continents and a recent common physical origin for all the inhabitants. The fact is clearly that we do not know enough about the geology of the various continents and islands, and it is a fallacy to assume that continents, even of our own time, have no relation with the former existence of the various now separated areas.

I can show that time asymmetry in the sense of a time flow has origin in asymmetry in relativistic kinematics (and is not a time arrow emerging in the course of evolution). The asymmetry in special relativity is due to the fact that, if we compare an observer at rest with an object in motion parallel to his proper time direction, the object has to shrink in the direction opposite of its proper time. If there were no such shrinking, there would exist no cause why the object should evolve in the proper time direction, as this is the direction in which the object shrunk and therefore the smallest. From the point of view of relativistic kinematics, it is arbitrary, which object moves in which direction. This lack of",

This changed quickly in April 1959, when a group of test pilots, both military and RFC volunteers, were called upon to begin training for an anticipated space race. They trained in simulated environments, including the centrifuge. Some of the men had come up with a term for their training: \"The New Age Aeronauts.\"\nSoon after the announcement that NASA was forming, the Mercury Astronaut Corps was established at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Lewis Laboratory, better known today as \"the astronaut office,\" to select pilots for the first manned space project. This elite pilot group would be the select 10% of all the pilots who had come through",
        "By August 1805, Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally. Facing a potential invasion from his enemy Russia, as the alliances he had established so carefully came to pieces, Napoleon knew that time was no longer on his side. The Spanish throne was now at the centre of European affairs.\nThe question of whom, French or Spanish, to be King of Spain had been unsettled since King Philip V died in 1746. When Joseph Bonaparte took the throne of Spain, he did so as the _first_ of the Bourbons in Spain since Philip V, and as the first King of France who was also King of Spain. By law, Joseph was to succeed Ferdinand VII as Prince of Asturias. But as the Napoleonic regime collapsed, a different son of the Spanish King appeared in Paris: 27-year-old Ferdinand.\nFerdinand VII, 'The Des",
        "In January 1938, Milt Gabler started recording for his new label, Commodore Records, and to allow for longer playing time of 10\u2033 records, he invented the technique of \u2018married\u2019 records by joining the last 3 minutes of each side to create a continuous mono performance. These \u2018married\u2019 records were the precursors of the long playing records or LPs, which only came about ten years later in 1948.\nOn February 12th, the very first Commodore recording was Louis Armstrong and his Orchestra \u2013 0126 and 0151 from a session at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem. On the same day, Commodore also started a \u2018Budget Series\u2019 under number 0100: these are now often referred to as 0100. However, the records came with a distinct type of label: the label",
        "The first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1900. For years, various railway companies operated the main lines, but these were integrated into the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1986, this company was divided into separate German and Soviet halves, and the section in Thuringia became part of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR. After German unification in 1990, the rail infrastructure in Thuringia was taken over by Deutsche Bahn. The federal government decided not to retain the existing, mainly north-south-oriented main lines but to realign and/or close them and to introduce new cross-country routes. These projects have been underway since 1997.\nApart from the main lines, several private railway lines were also built in the state. The first of those was the Drei",

        "In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the state of the army and also to take care of the problems of his children, who had been placed in local schools. He visited his son in Beijing, whom he loved dearly but saw but rarely, noting in dismay that he was overweight and out of shape, having \"gotten too much to eat\" while away at school and was not keeping company with the right class of girls. He returned the son's new watch, which he did not think was a gift that would be useful to the boy. Instead he gave him a watch with only an hour hand, explaining that a watch without hours that did not tell the time was better than one that was not used.\nAt about this time Mao and Peng decided that it would be in their mutual interest for the old marshal to leave the",

By 2009, the government was making strides towards its goal of transferring the oil industry into the private sector by allowing foreign investors to work within the oil, gas and refined-petroleum sectors. It also allowed foreigners to be involved in the exploration and extraction of phosphates. In addition, the government is in the process of expanding the tourism industry by allowing international chain hotels to operate in the country.\nLibya's main agricultural product is barley.\nLibya's agriculture has been based on state-provided irrigation schemes that were built on the assumption that the natural system of seasonal",
        "In response to attribution of recent climate change, the City of Melbourne, in 2002, set a target to reduce carbon emissions from Municipal Council facilities and operations by 10 per cent below FY 02 baseline levels over the period FY 03\u201308. Additionally, the City of Melbourne targeted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the City of Melbourne by at least 10 per cent below FY 02 baseline levels by 2010. This target is consistent with the Victorian Greenhouse Challenge Program target of an 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2050, through carbon accounting and neutralisation. The project assesses Melbourne\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions from municipal government facilities and operations and provides strategies that can be implemented by local governments in other Australian cities to achieve carbon emissions reduction targets.\nAirport planning and management",
        "The northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region are covered by the Thar Desert which extends from Pakistan to the Indian State of Gujarat. Some areas of the southwestern portion of Rajasthan are also part of the desert. In the past, this area was the home of nomadic tribes as it would be hard for settled communities to form with the unpredictability of the environment.\nThe Thar Desert is the largest desert in India and is one of the hottest parts of India during the summer as it is mostly devoid of vegetation. However, the desert is not completely barren. The desert plays host to many species of fauna and flora that are suited to the extreme environments of the arid and semi-arid parts of the desert. These species have adapted themselves to such an environment where the ground is completely bare and there is a lot of sand, little to no rainf"
