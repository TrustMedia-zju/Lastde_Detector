She said it is time to end the era of mass incarceration. \"My heart breaks for these young men and their families\", said Mrs Clinton, referring to black men killed in officer-involved shootings across the US since last year. The US needs \"a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.\" Mrs Clinton has called for campaign finance repeatedly on the campaign trail, despite controversy over money sourcing in her own Clinton Foundation and her immense fundraising. \"We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccounted money out of it, once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment,\" said Mrs Clinton at a speech in Iowa in April. Mrs Clinton has aligned herself with campaigns for higher minimum wage in the US. \"Fight for $15\", a US group pushing for",
        "Three officers were shot dead by an eastern European gang in a bungled east London burglary in December 1910. The murders led to the famous Siege of Sidney Street, in Stepney, east London, in January 1911. City of London Police unveiled the first memorial to Sgt Bentley, Sgt Tucker and Pc Choat at a ceremony at the scene of the tragedy. On 16 December 1910, a gang of Latvian revolutionaries tried to rob a jeweller's shop in Houndsditch. The gang fired on unarmed officers, killing three and seriously injuring two. Two of the gang members escaped and hid out in rooms at 100 Sidney Street.

Monika, the daughter of head constable Prem Sagar, said she wanted Indian forces to kill at least 10 Pakistani troops to avenge her father. Many on social media have shared similar sentiments using the hashtag badlalo (take revenge).

Ministers had \"made a mistake\" by rushing the measure through, she said. \"It's leaving a lot of women out of pocket,\" she told BBC's Woman's Hour. Plans to increase the state pension age for women from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020 were initially set out in 1995. 'Undue hardship' But the coalition government decided to speed up the process in 2011, resulting in the state pension age for women increasing to 65 in November 2018 and then to 66 by October 2020.

There was more drama right at the very end of the match when Marlon Pack's header was cleared off the line, with City's players and supporters feeling it had snuck over.

        "So how would a rise of 0.25% affect borrowers, and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 44% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so will not be affected by any immediate rise in rates. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. However, depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. Most homeowners - 56% - are on a standard variable rate (SVR) or a tracker mortgage, so will, in theory, be affected by a rate rise. However, as the Bank of England cut rates, most lenders",

Victims do not have to wait to be attacked if they are in their home and fear for themselves or others.

This is his definition: \"A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.\" Asperger later revised his thinking, but the tradition has stuck. Autism remains a condition predominantly associated with boys and men. Statistical studies over the years have proved inconclusive. A 1993 research paper in Sweden found a boy-to-girl ratio of four-to-one. Others put the ratio at 16-to-one. A more recent study, by the National Autistic Society in 2015, suggests it may be three-to-one.

Nick got the job against heavy odds. Last year, the company's training schemes had 10,000 applicants for 500 places. Despite a 2:1 degree, his A-level grades ruled him out of most top accountancy companies. Most still require at least the equivalent of three Bs at A-level before they will even consider applicants for trainee posts, either at school-leaver or graduate level. Nick's A-level grades were a B and two Cs.

After beating Leinster in last May's Pro12 final to round off a stunning 2015-16 campaign, Pat Lam's Connacht side got off to a dreadful start this season as home hammerings by Glasgow and the Ospreys were followed by a further 17-8 defeat by the Dragons.

Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up.

About 80,000 seasonal workers a year pick and process British fruit and veg. Most of them are from the European Union, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. One in five growers says they already have fewer pickers than they need. British Summer Fruits, the body which represents soft fruit growers, says labour shortages are now the worst seen since 2004. Recruitment was getting harder even before the vote to leave the EU.

They hope to agree a text that would form the basis of new global compact, to be signed in Paris next year. Many developing countries support a legally binding deal that would be structured in a similar way to the Kyoto Protocol, signed back in 1997. One key element of that agreement was that countries faced sanctions if they failed in their commitments to cut carbon. According to Lord Stern, a deal in Paris would work better if it steered away from this format. \"Some may fear that commitments that are not internationally legally-binding may lack credibility,\" he said. \"That, in my view, is a serious mistake.

The party's proposals represent a challenge to the austerity that has been a central feature of the eurozone's response to the financial crisis - bailout loans combined with spending cuts and tax rises to reduce borrowing needs and economic reforms to encourage growth. For the architects of that response - especially the European Commission and Germany - the idea of renegotiating the terms and reducing the debt is an unpalatable one. Germany and some other eurozone countries already have political problems with the bailouts - received by a total of five countries. Many voters resented the financial assistance, even though it was loans. Any suggestion that they won't be repaid in full will aggravate those concerns. The key to the Greek burden does lie with the eurozone and its taxpayers. Some 60% of the outstanding debt is bailout money",

After hearing that people actually lived in the warehouse of artists' studios and performance spaces known as the Ghost Ship, I needed to see for myself, to ensure Trista - the name I'll call her to protect her privacy - was not among the dead. At the scene many had gathered to grieve and pay their respects. There were also people like me, who had lost touch with their loved ones for weeks, months, or even years, and were fearful they were inside when the fire started.

In the first few years of her life, her mum was unable to care for Simone and her siblings, and so she was adopted when she was five, by her grandparents, Ronald and Nellie. She grew up in Texas and says her favourite subject at school was history. Simone had her first go at gymnastics during a trip when she was six.

        "The quantity of goods bought rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was stronger growth than economists had been expecting. The rise was driven by strong sales of household goods, clothing and shoes. That compensated for falling sales at supermarkets and other sellers of food and drinks. \"A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales this month,\" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. Retail sales rose by 1.5% in the three months to the end of June, which wipes out the 1.4% slide in sales over the first three months of the year. Economists prefer to look at figures over three months, which smooth out volatile moves from month to month. \"We shouldn't get too carried away by these figures. After all, the retail sales figures are very volatile on a month-by-month basis. And the heatwave",

        "The Consumer Rights Act 2015 will make it far easier for groups of consumers to seek compensation from firms that have fixed prices and formed anti-competitive agreements to fix prices.\n\nCompetition law means that agreements between companies not to undercut one another or to fix the prices that they charge to customers are not allowed.

This applies to claims brought in the High Court or the Court of Session in Scotland.\n\nThe new regime for group action allows large numbers of people who are suffering from an anti-competitive agreement or who have been wrongly charged prices that are higher than they should have been for a period of time to raise a legal claim.\n\nThis means",
