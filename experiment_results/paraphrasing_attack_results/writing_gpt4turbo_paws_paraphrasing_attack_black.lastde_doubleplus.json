She took fencing classes in college, so she uses her magic to compress the mana in the air into the solid form of a rapier. Her daughter Marie practices both fencing and kendo, but she can't use magic. Personally, I think it's because she's a latent Silver mage, like her father was.

Imagine schools where kids learn to control the elements alongside algebra!\n\nMoreover, magic would be accessible to everyone, but with a twist \u2013 it grows stronger based on acts of kindness and empathy. This way, the use of magic itself promotes a more compassionate and harmonious society. The more good you do, the more powerful your magical abilities become.\n\nTransportation would be revolutionized by teleportation spells and language barriers would disappear thanks to universal translation enchantments.
