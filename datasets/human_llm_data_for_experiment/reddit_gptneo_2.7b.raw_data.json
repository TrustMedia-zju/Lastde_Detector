No, that is not what you need to do. Projectile, be it bullet, arrow or other, either needs to stay in, or out. Are you within hours to a day or so from definitive care (surgery, hospital)? Projective stays in. The body will have already started to form clots around it, you don\u2019t want to disrupt them. Are you day or more from definitive care? Balance between haemorrhage and infection swings. Time to get the projectile out - it carried microorganisms from the clothing and skin into the body. Yes, they\u2019re already in there, but removing the item decreases the infective load. Okay, so we\u2019ve dealt with what to do with the projectile. Now, the bleeding. The projectile will have caused local tissue damage, disrupting blood vessels and causing localised bleeding.",

I mean I had skin to skin immediately after birth, all the good stuff, no separation from baby, and I just felt absolutely nothing. Tired, numb. Sort of \u2018oh a baby, how sweet\u2019 but nothing more. I actually did bleed quite a lot as well and my milk production was very low so could be related. I had some pretty severe pre-natal depression and some bad experiences leading up to the birth, so I think I maybe just wasn\u2019t capable of it on a neurological level. But then I also know other women who say the same thing - that they were around all these narratives of \u2018when you see/hold your baby it feels amazing and powerful\u2019 and just found that wasn\u2019t the case for them.

        "Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning? Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less",
        "about boiling water for births It is very much a thing that is/was helpful for a short period of time -- when home births predominated but were attended by medical professionals who knew about sterilizing equipment, which you can see in the UK in the early seasons of Call the Midwife. They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment might possibly be a) known and b) useful. Otherwise it's a trope used for humor, and fair enough! Childbirth is intense",
        "Why will the body continue to store excess fat to the point where it jeopardizes the person\u2019s health? I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin,",

[This graphic](https://imgur.com/gallery/9KdKYPN) gives a detailed view of the inner workings of your throat. The trachea (gases) and esophagus (solids/liquids) are layered together. There are muscles and valves that close off to make sure liquid or solids don\u2019t enter the lungs while swallowing or vice versa air into the stomach while breathing. And why you shouldn\u2019t try to breathe in while drinking liquids (like drinking while heavy panting after exercise or thinking water will help while choking\u2026) When you either accidentally override the automatic muscle closures or are too incapacitated to close those muscles properly anymore you get what\u2019s called \u201caspiration\u201d.

As it happens, several of my friends run high-end cheese shops in Paris and I've had the chance to visit their installations and ask questions over the years, and OP's question was one of the first ones I though of, as it's a natural one. Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference. This is why you can take",

If not associated with any pain and not severe, you don\u2019t require anti-pyretics. People just do it because it makes them feel like they\u2019re doing something sometimes. We also know now that the fever isn\u2019t needed for most infections. Your body also has an extremely complex immune system. Fever is part of the primitive response. Primitive response reacts first while the more complex processes ramp up. Macrophages start devouring viruses and bacteria and present pieces of them to T cells.

Your question stems from the fact that we, as humans, don\u2019t always have an intuitive grasp of how much energy a process requires. Here\u2019s an example: I have a 3000mAh lithium battery that can fly my drone for like 45 minutes. Let that sink in: it can fucking FLY. I can get it to rest on the roof of my nearby Costco, come back, tail my car, and do all of this for a decent amount of time. This same 3000mAh battery could also power a single one of my heated gloves to\u2026 make it a bit warm for 2 hours. Wow.

        "how does decompression illness kill you? In diving decompression illness is actually a couple different potential things. The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death. To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per",

        "Why covering extremities in our bodies (especially our **feet for example, by wearing socks**) is so essential to warm our bodies. This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards. Scientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with multiple layers of clothing,",

The thing is, humans are actually pretty hard to infect. We are covered in an ablative layer of keratine that is constantly growing and sluffing off. We have only a few openings in that later to the outside world, and they all have defenses to keep stuff out. This is necessary because the outside world would love to kill you. You are covered in bacteria that would readily devour you if it could only get inside. Your mouth has antiviral agents inside it. Your nose and ears are filled with ablative layers of wax that trap pathogens so they can't get inside. Your eyes are flushed with fluids. Your digestive system has acids and immune agents to keep stuff out. Etc... Basically for a pathogen to be successful, it needs to evolve a way to overcome your defenses effectively. Some viruses",

A small infection for example which could be deadly for a senior citizen without medical attention might go unnoticed for days if the patient is not able to complain about pains. Even leaving a seriously ill Alzheimer patient unattended for a few minutes at night could cause you to miss them jumping on their bed falling over and braking bones, which for seniors could be fatal as their body does not heal the same way as adults.

Similarly, it bothers me when people require a purpose for a specific animal or species to exist. We can assign a benefit to the ecosystem. But it's usually arbitrary. Things just be. And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed. If you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier.

Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong. I know some people will say the Iron in your blood isn't magnetic, but the interesting thing is that MRIs make things magnetic because an MRI is two magnets.

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it\u2019s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don\u2019t the bladder will push against a close valve, and this",

As an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination). The band is then left in place to prevent blood form flowing into the leg and thus from bleeding into the surgical site.

Cocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors.

Taste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds. Many different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed.

But that\u2019s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap.

Basically in species that reproduce like humans, the sex ratio automatically go to a 50/50 split. The thinking is if anyone in the species had a mutation that would result in more offspring of one gender, that would make the other gender have a greater chances of finding a mate and make having children of that gender preferable to pass on your genese. Whenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender. So like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle. That said 50/50 is not the real ratio in humans. It is just the approximate ratio of humans during their main reproductive years. Humans actually are born with slightly more boys than girls, but because boys die more than girls that is whittled down",

We can only say what seems currently likely. Relatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that \"established\" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean. \"Regression to the mean\", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better.

Having a large and heavy head and a weak neck will make it very hard to hold the head anywhere other than straight over the rest of the body.

An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. Women's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a shorter gait and wider hips. This contributes to more efficient walking, standing, and less wear and effort expended on joints and muscles",

And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of the fluid.

They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't stop, which will eventually make you stop breathing because the muscles can't coordinate.

They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content. And if you have a hard cheese like cheddar, and it gets wet and then molds, it's also not safe because of the moisture. Then soft cheeses like Brie, you'll get opinions both ways.

Minor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous. Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for. Dark colors however, were. As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation. Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation. Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white. You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration.

The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work.

Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators.

It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium. By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body.

YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander. When you mouth breathe, your tongue is down and you're not wearing",

Just like a door hinge there is a range of motion of a joint. It can go from fully opened to fully closed. Now imagine you don\u2019t use the door for 20 years, it will be harder to open all the way it will struggle and creak. The same thing happens to our joints if you don\u2019t use them through their full range of motion.

        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic. This means your kidneys need to kick into overdrive and filter out the salty blood as quickly as possible by just dumping out large amounts of water carrying the salt away.",

I mean, certainly there is an element of metabolism but a lot of fat middle aged people get there because of the financial change. They go from ramen and sparse finances justifying fewer meals to having more money and eating more in a sitting because their control was dictated by their wallet and not their constitution and habits. I also think elderly people tend to be at a point where they made the mistake and slimmed back down. Also more free time usually means more physical activity.

        "Why can't we just spend however long it takes to brush our teeth over and over again until they're as clean and white as they were when we first got them? (Like dentist office billboard advertisement levels of white teeth) Stains aren't the same thing as plaque or dirt. Staining is in the tooth like dye on cloth, not on the tooth like paint on a wall. One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel. Teeth need to be whitened with something that can oxygenate the enamel and allow the bleaching effect to take place. That's why most at-home whiteners like Crest White strips or whitening mouthwash contain hydrogen peroxide in the formula, as do most professional whitening solutions available from the dentist. These formulas open the",
        "Why are Dolphins specifically friendly towards humans only and not towards other animals/fish like sharks? Dolphins - like humans - are highly social and communicative animals. Communication and social activity comes naturally to both of us. This isn't true of most animals a dolphin is likely to encounter. Most sea animals - fish, cephalopods (like octopus and squid) and sharks aren't social at all, and most aren't intelligent. They have either no interest or no capacity to interact with anyone - in the case of fish, dolphins likely just see them as food, in the same way most of us view a chicken. The only other intelligent, social animals a dolphin is likely to ever meet is other ceteceans (whales and dolphins) and humans. Whales are social, intelligent animals, but aren't quite as smart as humans or dolphins.

Are there notable side effects from this? Birth control are synthetic *Progestins* AKA Progestogens that trick the body into thinking it's already pregnant. Normally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. Progestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it. It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. Progestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant. The point of this is essentially push pause on the normal ovulation cycle while the fetus is developing, so you don't end up with a second, concurrent fetus several months later. That would mean",

In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the brain. This is how all vertebrates know what's up and what's down. We also detect movement this way, when they accelerate,",

        "why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses? Wild horses who can't cope without them die:) But the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet and legs that a wild horse would only experience rarely.

The liver's primary job is to make compounds in your blood take on a form that's easier for the kidneys to excrete; in practice this means making them more soluble in water. All in all the liver is about making things you want more available to you, and making wastes easier to excrete. The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and the stomach, it's the first pass which tries to balance everything in a way that works for your body. The liver breaks down large molecules into smaller and more easily absorbed ones as well, it does a LOT of different things really.

Horses do have an edge on us and can out-distance us, if only partially because we've spent centuries breeding them to be exceptional at marathon running. For us the factors that give us an edge are: * We can sweat and don't have a lot of fur so we're pretty efficient at cooling * Fabulous leg muscles * Bipedal motion keeps our lungs and heart able to function separately from our running * We are capable of \"anaerobic respiration\". That means our cells can keep producing energy (albeit less efficiently) after the oxygen in our blood isn't sufficient to power them. (First off, we have to talk about people in decent shape. Being out of shape kills most of these advantages.) The sweating, horses are pretty good at it too. They have a coat and that hurts them a little. But again, we've bred them",

Your body can generate energy to fuel your muscles in different ways. At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce",
        "Why is duck meat red meat and can be consumed medium rare and chicken meat white meat which should be cooked thoroughly even though they're both birds? Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That\u2019s 165 \u00baF / 74 \u00baC. The appearance and texture will be different due to the difference in myoglobin and fat content. The higher fat content in duck meat makes it juicier and more moist compared to chicken. The higher myoglobin content will make it look more like what we associate with medium rare from steaks. The chance of chickens carrying food borne pathogens like Salmonella is higher than that of ducks because of how chickens are farmed compared to ducks. Much more extensively and in more crowded conditions. That means the meat has a higher chance",

        "- Why is it so easy to overwater a plant, but sticking the roots directly underwater is how you propagate it? As long as the roots have oxygen, they will survive. This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering.

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process, thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed. It passes through much quicker and everything in it will be absorbed",

Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first.

Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you\u2019re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good.

Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing. Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. Humans are specialized in... well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances. Our arms can't easily haul our body weight up a tree or be used for walking, but can accurately throw things, build tools. Once humans started building tools natural selection greatly preferred the most nimble, flexible hands and arms that could make better",

Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral accumulation on the surface, it's usually lymph nodes swelling in response to chemicals released by the infection as your body takes action to fight the infection. - if it does kill anything it will be surface level membranes and cells. - the alcohol needs to be pretty strong and it still needs time to take effect. - just about anything can kill bacteria and viruses pretty easily.... When it's not in your body. You can kill cancer cells in a petri dish with a gun, to narrate the xkcd comic. The problem is that you want the patient to survive.

That's basically the short version. When a hole between two liquid containers is made, effectively connecting them, the liquid flowing through that hole will be from the higher pressure container to the lower pressure container. In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container. Incidentally this effect is also behind why when the city water supply has been shut off for a while, then turned back on, the water always comes out of your faucet a bit discolored (yellow or brown) until you let it run for a while. And you're usually told not to drink it until you've left it on for a while to flush water through the",

Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis. When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition",
        "How and why can some metals like copper be antibacterial? It is important to remember that bacteria and cells aren't like us. Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage. Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth. The second big thing to remember is that all living things are essentially just chemical processes. You put two molecules next to each other and things start to happen. All living things are essentially the universe's largest R\u00fcbe Goldberg machines. So, what happens is that when the bacteria touch the",

Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer. However, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure.",

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine",

Once it\u2019s detached, the blood flow stops, and it dies like any other organ that\u2019s been cut off, and no longer does anything to help the baby.

Of the five main types of Asbestos fiber, the most commonly used type is Crysotile. The main hazardous characteristic of it is that when it becomes *fryable* the fibers tend to break into shards that have a weird physical structure that results in the ends of the fragments to have curled, hook-like ends that resemble microscopic velcro. The hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively. This results in the particles remaining in the body for MUCH longer, and that causes a body to resort to other",
        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain. Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got. Humans have larger brains than other primates, and a similar neuron density, so we've got a lot of neurons AND a lot of brains. Minke whales have a brain that's 2.7 kg, compared to the humans average of 1.4 kg. But they only have 2/3rds the amount of neurons in a",

It's better for those oxygen atoms than being by themselves, but they *really* want some extra electrons, and are basically fighting to gain possession of the other atom's. There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it. One big strong oxygen can take care of a single molecular hydrogen too. Its a pretty great set up for both of them. So when molecular hydrogen and oxygen get to hanging out, it tends to be pretty",

You can reflect on things that just happened and analyse the past to learn and grow, and also can comprehend that a future exists and begin to understand how it could pan out. It alters your perception of literally the tiniest experiences, and I mean not just knowing language, but people who speak different languages think differently because of the way their brain processes information.

The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit.

But if you drink lots of water the day after, you can flush out all that extra salt and now your fingers aren\u2019t swollen and you can remove your rings easily again. Our bodies typically maintain an important balance between how much salt/water circulates on its own, and literally flooding the system with either one will have side effects ranging from minor like swollen fingers to fatal.

Given the 5% body weight you say is necessary to occlude a skin capillary (at what blood pressure, by the way, since blood pressure would have a large impact on that), it seems unlikely that simple shifts in stance (eg swaying) would be significant enough to reduce occlusion pressure below critical opening pressure of the capillaries. So why don't the tissues of the sole of the feet become rapidly damaged in people who stand all day? 15 minutes of ischemia is enough to cause cell death, so people who spend hours standing in one place (such as grocery store clerks) should be experiencing numerous lesions on the sole of their foot, no?

Bats are huge carriers and a big reason why we cant irradicate in the US, but the UK has done a fairly good job at it and a few other areas I believe? Their teeth are also so small, they don't always leave marks. You get bit or scratched by a carrier and even there's been inhalation of vapors from bat feces apparently that causes initial exposure.

Starting in the early Edo period, a new Yokai (Demon) appeared in Japan: the [Korori](https://monster.fandom.com/wiki/Korori?file=Korori.JPG). A tricky monster that breathed a foul breath spreading an invisible sickness that afflicted entire households and sometimes took whole villages. We call it Cholera today, and the 1862 outbreak in Edo killed hundreds of thousands. It was brought entirely due to contact with traders from the west. But of course it didn't have the same total devastation effect that was seen in the Americas and there are a number of reasons for this. Native Americans were uniquely susceptible to diseases from Eurasia because their immune systems were primed differently than Eurasian people's. Specifically, when your immune system is developing your body can specialise in creating cells which are either extremely effective against microbes / infectious diseases, or against parasites like",
        "Why do we feel hungry, weak, or lightheaded at all, when the body can just burn the stored fat? If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise. But, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still (making you cold/weak/tired) - it might do both, but the homeostasis process is just trying to guard your energy stores. If the food is convincingly",

Now lets look at heat produced. The adult's 100 kg body is built and shaped proportional to the 25 kg kid. * Kids have a higher surface area / mass ratio. They lose heat faster than adults.

It's a way of preventing the symptoms that we take medicines for.

In some species the eggs or larva are carried on the fins of the adult, and then the adult, still feeding on its fin-meal, will come up and go into the water, probably to die. The eggs of these tiny fry are carried in the body. The larger specimens may enter the water by \"buoyancy\", floating on the surface of the",

Humans (and all other things) evolved to minimize their need for food, and to maximize the nutrients they need. Plants are also \"energy producers\" for animals. Therefore, we can feed the extra nutrients we need as needed. Animals have been adapting for millions of years to produce more food. They have discovered ways to eat food more efficiently as they need it, and to reduce the amount of food they need to eat. Plants are adaptable. To them, if it's better to eat a lot of something than to eat little, then to the plants it was better to eat the little.

And by making a push, the organism creates a new equilibrium. It",

Dogs, cats, and a lot of other land animals know to swim with the help of their feet, hands, sense of smell, and the use of echolocation. When we were still humans, we learned to be capable of using our hands to steer a boat, use a bow and arrow, build a bow, use tools, and even ride a bike. We learned how to walk without hands, and then learned how to walk with our hands. We also learned how to run (through running and climbing) without hands, how to pick (through lifting), and how to dig (through digging), and many other abilities which we would not have acquired.\n\nI'm quite sure that most if not all of us are capable of swimming, and have used swimming skills in several different situations, since we're still learning how to swim.\n\nQuote:\n\nI don't",

This growth chamber is a physical manifestation of the way our bodies evolved, and it is responsible for our body size.\nThis internal growth chamber is filled with water. Its height is approximately one third that of our own body, and its volume is about half the volume of our own body.

These \"over-pot\" plant varieties need a lot more water than your average growing container.

Dolphins communicate using a multitude of vocalizations and can produce sounds which can be almost sonar-like in frequency. Dolphins use their heads with great dexterity too: They sometimes use their snouts to spear fish out of the water. They can hold their prey securely with their dorsal (back) fin. They sometimes dive deep, and can use the undulations on their back to dig out fish, crabs and other objects from the mud.

        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They just begin to learn how to form new memories when the age of 5 or so is reached, and then these memories are retained to a large extent. Children also may develop their social competence early, whereas adults generally only start learning things as an adult.\n\nYou could also argue that there is also a reason for lack of memory at such a younger age. Most of us start having babies at around age 8 or 9 (if we are lucky, like the author), and we learn to have children only later in life. Also, we know (or believe) that babies cannot form memories of any sort until their brains reach a certain age, and then they start learning. The fact is that children who are born in the early years don\u2019t have the ability to differentiate between memories that are past and those that are not. But, in",

Humans, and most microbes, can sense and react to even minute changes in their environment, they are not passive. When bacteria multiply they create their own changes to the nutrients and moisture conditions in which they grow. Bacteria may respond to small changes in physical or chemical conditions by turning on and off many processes. Bacteria respond to light, chemicals, pH changes, temperature, magnetic fields, and most chemical signals with chemicals called secondary signals. These signals affect behavior, growth and physiology. The primary and secondary signals, and the physical characteristics of the bacterium changes the pH levels of growth.

Most viral particles quickly become non-viable because they have lost their envelope, their proteins, and are coated in enzymes from their environment that will inactivate, digest, and inactivate proteins. Even if they do manage to replicate asexually, they will still be in an energy-less, non-replicative state, and this is the nature of viruses, which can only go about replicating their genes and genomes via an elaborate molecular machinery that uses cellular energy.\n\nAn example of this is that many RNA viruses, such as some coronaviruses and Influenza viruses, require a special protein produced in the cell that is necessary for entry into the cell and replication in a single transcriptional step. The new generation of drugs and vaccines are based on this mechanism, for example. Another way in which viruses are sterilized is by making the virus inactivated, or by destroying",

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, per capita, has an average maternal mortality ratio of 8.4/100,000 live births, which is the highest globally.\n\nThis report shows that the USA, per capita, has an average maternal mortality ratio of 8.4/100,000 live births, which is the highest globally.

        "Why did humans get stuck with periods while other mammals didn't? It\u2019s because we are always fertile, instead of coming into heat a few times a year, and even if we do experience menopause\u2014the loss of ovarian follicles\u2014we\u2019ll never really recover the menopause we experienced when our grandmothers gave birth to us. At the same time, other mammals are capable of regular, long cycles. And these animals aren\u2019t just trying to conceive more offspring; they\u2019re trying to keep their own fertility ticking over.\n\nIn what would\u2019ve been a world-changing discovery, a male tree shrew\u2019s sperm was found to have a greater number of chromosomes than those of his female counterparts. This means the animals were capable of producing and fathering many identical offspring. And this is the reason why species like the tree shrew still exist; because those other mammals couldn\u2019t keep producing sperm because a few chromosomes made them",
        "Why do hangovers get worse with age? There could be a lot of factors. A lot of hangovers are intensified by dehydration, so it could also be related to dehydration. But I think my biggest reason is that hangovers taste better... they taste like a fresh beer, for a couple of hours after a long day. Also my hangover is milder after one night than two nights, when the hangover can be so bad that I just wanted to crawl under my blanket and die.\n\nMost of these hangovers are actually made worse by your immune system being screwed up by stress. That\u2019s why taking vitamins like C, B, E, zinc and iron can help with that.\n\nSo I\u2019d say it\u2019s really down to the quality of the diet, your gut microbiome, your sleep schedule, stress, and hydration.\n\nIt sounds like part of the problem is the lack of sleep. I didn\u2019t really experience",
        "How do doctors treat severe over-hydration (like the famous water drinking contest)? Doc here. TLDR- fix it in a reasonable time through either diuretics or intravenous fluids.\n\n(This is actually a thread to keep you abreast of the latest medical advances in medical and healthcare.)\n\nYou would just need to be able to get the water out with a catheter? Because if you take the saline out and don't get a lot of urine, why would you have to go to that length of a solution.\n\nWell, that was an option. They could also put in a temporary catheter to keep the bag over the patient to minimize leaking and then do a catheter/saline switch. This is the same technique I use to control my blood pressure. They only put in the saline when I'm on the blood pressure monitors. Then once I've set my blood pressure, the nurse will take the bag off and the catheter stays in",
        "Is it possible to see what ethnicity/race someone is just by looking at organs. For starters, race and ethnicity are social constructs. They are arbitrary labels that we assign to people that are perceived to be different. It\u2019s like asking someone what religion they are; some people know the difference between Christianity, Islam and Judaism, but they only think they\u2019re a Christian. Similarly, there are biological differences between people. We know that race and ethnic groups are not identical. We know that races and genders can be seen differently but the underlying biological differences are real. What if we could look at a person\u2019s DNA and say that they probably belong to a particular group. It would be really cool.\n\nA man walked into a bar, wearing sunglasses. He ordered a drink of whiskey, then came and got his hat and glasses and sat down. He put his hat on and sat in his chair. He took off his sunglasses to reveal a very pale blond man,",
        "why does an IV drop into that capsule that\u2019s half full of iv and half air? I work on a ship where we have non-invasive mechanical infusion pump access into the circulatory system of people. That seems like a bad idea, but the nurses don\u2019t say a word about it? They\u2019re all busy with patients, of course, with all the time they have! They also have nurses that are a few years older than me, so they all pretty much take my cues as to when I need to eat.\n\nSo I have a very very tiny amount of food for a couple of months and a nice, very large needle on a nice vein that\u2019s probably too big for the patient.

        "What are the structural benefits of nails versus claws? Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok\u00e9mon breeding, Vaporeon's claws are the only evolutionary step. This, in turn, means that all of the clawed Pok\u00e9mon belong to the group, unless you consider a Pok\u00e9mon able to adopt a claw with some strange mating traits as being able to undergo further evolutionary.\n\nThe second theory makes sense, but you would also be ignoring the fact that Vaporeon also has claws on his hands and feet and feet at some point in the series. Also, why don't we see Pikachu with claws on any of his body parts?\n\nOn another note, in the show, there were several times when the Pidove would stand by Pidgey and say \"The Pidgey will have to go without it\" to which Pidgey can see they are actually communicating because Pidgey did not recognize her message but was confused about the meaning of it",

And what about during stress? We don\u2019t have all the answers, unfortunately. One thing we do know is that your brain requires specific nutrients that are scarce in our diet \u2014 things like fatty acids, B vitamins, magnesium, coenzyme Q10, and tryptophan.\nBeverage is one of the easiest nutritional interventions to incorporate into your nutrition plans. It will help you meet your needs for electrolytes and fluids.

        "why does the body react so suddenly to viruses? When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patrollers called NK cells. NK cells are found throughout the body. They are specialized in the recognition and fight off of cancerous tumours. When you have an outbreak of anything that looks bad they will come to your rescue. But when you first encounter a virus that looks bad they do nothing that helps in this first encounter. This delay in the immune response to viruses is one of the reasons that there is the virus. So, there is no chance that the virus can survive without you.\n\nThe body has hundreds if not thousands of different types of cells, the most important in this process is the white blood cells called leukocytes. These white blood cells are so important in fighting viral infections.\n\nIf your body is fighting a viral infection the white cell count is going down. The lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+, CD21",
        "Why is working out good for you but working a physical job isnt good for you in the same way? It's the thousands of hours of repetition and it's the monotony, in the sense that being in your current position isnt necessarily the most interesting. There is such a high pressure to perform that even an 80 hour workweek cannot completely avoid burnout and it's not uncommon for these people to give up.\n\nSome people, some conditions, yes it's a very broad spectrum of people like me, give up for a period of time when trying to stick to something they find boring because i'm sure its really really boring. But eventually, you tend to do something new. For example, you find out you have a huge talent for cooking and i just bought a book on it so you go to the market and buy the ingredients like it was cooking a meal for the rest of your life until you start to see your skills for yourself. This is what i'm talking",
        "what actually happens in your body when you become more fit? Great question, and love the answers. I started running 3 years ago, ran my first 5km last year in 2014, and have completed my first half marathon since last year\u2019s Vancouver Marathon in May of 2016. Although not as fast as I thought, my endurance runs are about 1.5 hour per week and my first two marathons were about 2 hours 30mins each. After completing my marathons, my endurance runs were about 2 hour 30 mins a week and have increased to about 3 hour a week. In addition, my runs outside the gym have increased to about 2 hours 20 mins per week.\n\nWhile on a family vacation back before the Vancouver Marathon, my oldest son asked me a very similar question. He asked, \u201cMom, how much weight do you have before your workout? I mean, do you get fat before working out or before running?\u201d He asked me the question as",
        "If rabies needs direct contact to spread, and also kills its host within a few weeks, then how is it not \"extinct\" yet? The disease is \"extinct\" as are many other diseases, the \"longevity\" of diseases is largely due to many factors - lack of contact with people, natural barriers - a virus, bacterium, bacteriophage, being the most notable, though the presence of a vaccine can cause vaccine protection to be temporary.\n\nThe answer to the \"longevity question\" is usually \"because there are many individuals\" and each \"inherits\" from a particular host. When one individual passes away, the species dies out, but at any given time not all of the individual's progeny survive to reproduce. The question of longevity is usually stated with regards to viruses, however, many viruses can only spread through direct contact, they are not contagious via inhalation but may be spread by direct contact via blood, saliva, or vaginal",

Starting in the early Edo period, smallpox spread from India to Japan and China, through Persia, to Russia, Korea, and through Constantinople and Constantinople to other parts of the world. By the 16th century, smallpox had destroyed populations in China, Japan, Greece, China, and India.\n\nWe think of these ancient civilizations as pre-civilized. They were not; they were in the middle of the world and their technology is difficult to measure in modern times. We look back on them as having a high technology, for example, the use of tools, ceramics, metallurgy, and the use of metals, but we know that none of these things are as advanced as they could have been.\n\nIn one sense things have changed a great deal since the early days.

        "Why do we feel hungry, weak, or lightheaded at all, when the body can just burn the stored fat? If you are feeling weak and lightheaded, and your stomachs are empty, then it is time to stop overdoing your eating. You are not burning stored fat, you are burning stored fat for energy, which is what I will discuss next in this chapter.\n\n## WHAT IS STORED FAT, AND WHAT CAUSES IT TO REFLECT IN YOUR BREATH\n\nWe humans have been evolving to live a long time. That's why our brains have evolved so well, so that we can hold a conversation with someone who does not speak our language (or even know what we look like). We have advanced our culture and technology at the same rate we have advanced our brains. As a result of all this development, we have now come to live in a world of information that requires the processing of large amounts of information over and over again. This has meant",
        "Why the elderly body odor is so strong? As a person ages the body naturally slows down. This includes all parts of the body. Whereas a younger person can work tirelessly and without rest in a way that is completely effortless, to a middle aged person the body takes up so much more energy that the person can hardly move at all. The human body is very inefficient. This means that even though a younger person sleeps for a week in a completely fit and comfortable bed, it only requires that energy equal in size to just a fraction of what his older body really needs just to get up from a night\u2019s sleep. Some people are even able to work just a little longer every day of their life to continue their busy work.\n\nHowever, some people suffer from so called body odor. This is due to the fact that they are just aging, not because of a medical condition. This age related change to the human body is not entirely new, but in recent years more and more",
        "Why does it seems that children usually have a much greater physical disposition/stamina than the average adults? lets look at numbers. Say a kid weighs 60kg and an adult 50kg. The kid has more muscle and the kid has more natural agility and a much better balance which means the kid is almost always at the optimum physical condition as regards to sport and physical fitness.\n\nThe thing which the average/normal individual can never do as physically is the same thing.\n\nWhen you compare the physical activity that children do daily with the physical activity of the average/normal adult and you notice that children are more active. Say kids run daily for two hours for a month and a day in a year.\n\nAt the end of the year, your kid just might have ran for 18 hours in that month and a day and still have about 3% of the amount of calories of the average/normal adult.
