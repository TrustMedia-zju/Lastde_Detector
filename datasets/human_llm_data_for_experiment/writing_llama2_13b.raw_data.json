Captain Yenrir stared at the monitors, easily multi-tasking as he absorbed multiple monitors worth of data his science and engineering teams had prepared for him. The good news was, the engineers could probably effect makeshift repairs that would at least get them home. It would take a months to recreate full replicas of the systems they had lost, but life sciences could make nutrient suspensions that would keep them from starving, and engineering said there was plenty of power from the solar arrays to scrub the atmosphere indefinitely, so a few months of discomfort was the worst they faced in that area. It concerned him somewhat to think what they might find when they finally got home, but for the moment, that was overshadowed by his second concern: What really worried him was the data on the second monitor.",
