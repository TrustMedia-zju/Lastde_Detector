It doesn't really have a direction, or desired outcomes.\n\nStep by step, generation by generation, it runs through the simple process of \"is this genetic combination more likely to become common in the population than another genetic combination?\"\n\nIf so, it becomes more common, and you get a shift in the population. If not, it doesn't. Probably. This all has a random element to it, and there are all sorts of factors involved.\n\nIn the case of dinosaurs, it is tricky to know how smart they got, but some may have been as smart as modern big cats. Some modern dinosaurs (birds) can be pretty smart as well.\n\nBut as for them not getting as intelligent as humans or dolphins, they didn't need to be. It is kind of like asking why cats don't evolve into dogs - they have no reason to, cats are very well suited to being cats, and dogs are very good at being dogs. Cats (hyenas aside) make terrible dogs.\n\nDinosaurs were very good at being dinosaurs as they were (until the global climate changed and suddenly no one was good at being a dinosaur). There was no particular pressure on them to get smarter. What's a T-Rex going to do with the ability to recognise itself in a mirror when there aren't any mirrors?\n\nIt's also important to remember that \"intelligence\" isn't a linear thing; it is a vague, complicated concept with all sorts of different aspects. For example, some modern octopuses can be pretty good at solving certain problems and mimicking their environment, but their social intelligence is pretty terrible, and they lack generational learning. Are they more or less intelligent than a creature not as good at solving problems but with better social interactions?","1":"When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate\/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight.\n\nAdditionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can’t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it’s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don’t the bladder will push against a close valve, and this pressure will rise and can damage the seals leading to a leaky bladder later in life. The reason why this isn’t a problem at night time is because when your asleep, your brain doesn’t send those squeeze signals to the bladder, so you’re usually fine, however in children or people who are incapacitated like drunk people, there brain is not fully functional and so the brain can accidentally send signals when it’s supposed to be sleeping, leading to a wet bed and an unhappy parent\/partner","2":"A matter of scale.\n\nResistance of our bones or of the exoskeletons (the \"skin\", if you want) of insects depends on the *area* of their cross section.\n\nThe forces applied when moving, falling (or getting slapped), on the other hand, depend on the mass involved (from inertia), that is the *volume*.\n\nBut area and volume don't scale in the same way: area is proportional to the *square* of the size, while for a volume it's the *cube* (third power). That's just geometry. Imagine an ant being the size of an elephant. All its dimensions would be roughly multiplied by something like 500, the strength of its legs by 500^2 = 250,000 but its weight by 500^3 = 125,000,000… and the poor beast would break down under its own weight. (So no giant ants outside of science fiction movies.) And the other way round if you decrease the dimensions, an elephant the size of an ant would be ridiculously over-designed.\n\nThat's the reason why elephants need column-like legs to walk around while spiders, for example, can make do with very long and slender ones. And why small kids can fall without hurting themselves seriously while adults can break a bone just by slipping. (There's also the matter of bones acting as levers, so another size effect, but we'll neglect that. It works in the same direction.)\n\nNow for swatting specifically, insect bodies are encased in a very tough but somewhat elastic \"hide\", a kind of armor. And the size effects I described make that when they hit something, a windowpane or your angry hand, the forces acting on that armor are spread over a much greater area, relatively speaking, than we are used to at our own scale. Being spread out their effects are mild and the insect doesn't shatter.\n\n(There are other interesting size effects. Water appears more and more viscous at small scale and the unicellular organism one can see under a microscope are swimming through something which behaves like treacle. And that's why they use cilia to propel themselves and not flippers.)","3":"> It's not about the selective breeding, it's about appearance of two pieces of fruit from the same tree, one is perfectly rounded and the other is nobbly, both are identical from a nutritional and taste point of view.\n\nThey aren't necessarily the same from a cooking or presentation point of view.\n\nI buy large bags of potatoes because my family eats a lot (probably too much =\/ ) of potatoes, but I regularly sort them based on size because preparation and cooking methods are impacted. Size\/shape uniformity matters in cooking. If I go to buy asparagus, I want them all roughly the same thickness because I plan to cook them the same way.\n\nI'm not stupid, I just know how to cook food. \n\nAnd it's not that I have no use for ugly or irregular vegetables, but I do have *less* use for them and therefore my shopping preferences will be geared towards pretty, uniform vegetables\/fruit.\n\nIf my supermarket had a bin of substantially discounted \"ugly\" tomatoes, I might buy them for making spaghetti sauce. But they don't. And I am not going to choose misshapen tomatoes for my BLT or caprese salad, because while they may taste the same [this is a functionally more difficult product to work with depending on how you plan to use the tomato](https:\/\/crabtreefarms.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ugly-tomato-final-460x392.jpg). \n\nThat inherently makes it less valuable. Not stupidity, just facts.","4":"I have an apple. It's filled with sugars, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, etc. It will be given a calorie value, say 100 calories. \n\nNow I have a sticky bun. It's also rated at 100 calories (for the sake of this example), but unlike the apple, it doesn't have any of the extra vitamins, minerals, etc. Instead it is jam packed with filler - carbohydrates and fats. \n\nSo for the same 100 calories, I can choose between the apple, which for that 100 calories, my body gets some carbs, some sugars, and then minerals and vitamins it can use for growth and repair. In other words, this 100 calories is well balanced with a multitude of things your body can use. \n\nWhereas the sticky bun is all carbs and fat. Your body cannot use any of that for long term growth or repair. All it can do is try to burn the carbs and store the fat. \n\nSo, we say \"empty calories\" because in the case of the sticky bun, you ate as many calories as the apple, but they were far less useful to your body in terms of the content making up those calories.\n\nTaking this one step further: sticky bun is designed to attract you more than the apple, so the risk is that over time, you consume more sticky buns than apples leading to a deficit in the building materials your body needs to repair and keep going, you end up taking on more fat then you expect (because these foods are purposely stuffed with it) which is far more than your body would normally get if you were following a regulated\/natural diet. Your body, designed to store fat when given it (for just in case energy emergencies) starts storing all of this extra fat and you gain weight.","5":"When you first encounter a virus the only defender is the innate immune system. These are generic patrollers. If evaded, the virus starts infecting and multiplying, and it takes a little while for the immune system to notice.\n\nWhen it does though… it’s war.\n\nFirst the innate system notices and begins to attack. White blood cells eat, spray acid, and rip themselves apart to deploy DNA webs. Macrophages join and attack. Inflammatory processes are activated. Complement proteins flood the area. Natural killer cells execute any cells that don’t look healthy. Debris accumulates, including virus parts.\n\nThen dendrites wander in and pick up the virus parts. They then float around the body until they encounter a dormant T cell with just the right receptors. This meeting is a serious one, with a two part confirmation. The lock clicks and then the dendritic cell confirms and twists the activation key.\n\nThe T Cell turns on ready to do violence, begins rapidly multiplying and makes its way to the battlefield. It begins targeted wholesale slaughter of infected cells, while also turbocharging the other immune cells and turning them into berserker killing machines. \n\nMeanwhile other cells called B cells have been activated and begin to produce increasingly good antibodies that stick to the virus, rendering it ineffective and shouting kill me to the immune cells.\n\nWith the virus eventually killed, the battlefield is cleaned up and the immune system slowly calms. Some records are stored for life in case the virus shows up again and you feel better and get off the couch.","6":"This comes up a lot, and it's often very wrong answers that get upvoted, or at least very very incomplete.\n\nThe Wikipedia page for [Manner of Death](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manner_of_death) states:\n\n>A death by natural causes results from an illness and its complications or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, other than infectious disease. For example, a person dying from complications from pneumonia, diarrheal disease or HIV\/AIDS (infections), cancer, stroke or heart disease (internal body malfunctions), or sudden organ failure would most likely be listed as having died from natural causes. \"Death by natural causes\" is sometimes used as a euphemism for \"dying of old age\", which is considered problematic as a cause of death (as opposed to a specific age-related disease); there are also many non-age-related causes of \"natural\" death, for legal manner-of-death purposes. (See Cause of death § Aging.)\n\nSome people get confused because there is a medical context, a legal context, and casual speech, ala *euphemism for \"dying of old age\"*...but even that may be too crude a grouping.\n\nContext is key, even similar context may have different sub-context.\n\n>There is particular ambiguity around the classification of cardiac deaths triggered by a traumatic incident, such as in stress cardiomyopathy. Liability for a death classified as by natural causes may still be found if a proximate cause is established,[2][3] as in the 1969 California case People v. Stamp.[4]\n\nA court may consider \"natural\" to mean \"not homicide or negligence\", or, it may find that \"natural causes\" is not sufficient enough, maybe they were old but *also* given the wrong medication, so the court would have to determine the exact cause to see if it was negligence or even murder.\n\nA medical determination may mean specifically old age, the pathology being somewhat irrelevant because every organ was about to fail....At the same time, a medical determination may need to know specifically, even in the case of old age, to trace pathology for research purposes.\n\nWhat if it was cancer from extreme radiation or toxin?  That's not necessarily \"natural\" in terms of finding liability, and not useful medically either...\n\nEvery different discussion containing \"natural death\" or \"natural causes\" would have to be taken in it's own individual context, the nature of the question asked, and the desires of the person giving the answer.\n\nSomeone talking about a loved one might say \"natural causes\" regardless of the cause because they simply don't want to talk about it.  A  Dr. or Lawyer, similarly may find the cause of death trivial, or extremely important.  Research would probably be the least likely to use \"natural causes\" specifically because the whole point is to study the miniscule cause\/effects.\n\nOther than that, there is no unifying rule that explains all possibilities.","7":">During walking and standing balance the moments of compression fully flush blood out. a post occlusive reactive hyperemia occurs on pressure release\n\nI hadn't considered the impact of reactive hyperemia in the capillaries of the sole of the foot.  Given the 5% body weight you say is necessary to occlude a skin capillary (at what blood pressure, by the way, since blood pressure would have a large impact on that), it seems unlikely that simple shifts in stance (eg swaying) would be significant enough to reduce occlusion pressure below critical opening pressure of the capillaries.  So why don't the tissues of the sole of the feet become rapidly damaged in people who stand all day?  15 minutes of ischemia is enough to cause cell death, so people who spend hours standing in one place (such as grocery store clerks) should be experiencing numerous lesions on the sole of their foot, no?\n\nAs for the diabetes - There is for example this paper: [https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1056872717302118](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1056872717302118) that supports what you're saying, but the OR is \\~1.02....that INCREDIBLY small.  That is drifting into \"give me a million people and I'll show you brown-haired people are taller\" - you look at enough things and you can statistically show any difference exists, but whether or not that difference is meaningful is a different question.  I would argue that, while those findings may be accurate, but they are not particularly meaningful (probably why a study of 100+ patients didn't wind up in a better journal).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile its been established for the last 40 years ([https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/292\/6513\/87.abstract](https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/292\/6513\/87.abstract)) that there is a large decrement in sympathetically-mediated vascular tone in those with diabetes.  Again, not my area of expertise, but I'd bet dollars to donuts that if one were to come the odds ratios between sympathetic deficits and impaired post-occlusion reactive hyperemia, sympathetic deficits would be a MUCH greater risk for developing lesions.","8":"The heart muscle itself, not so much. It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart.\n\nYou can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right atrium of the heart. You can also develop chemodectomas (tumors of special sensory cells) in the aortic body (which I guess is technically the artery leaving the heart..). Histiocytic sarcoma (a tumor arising from macrophages) also likes to hit the heart sometimes in some species..\n\nThere are other cell types within tissues that are relatively permanent and don't have stem cells - for example, nerve cells don't divide so tumors arising from the nerve cells themselves are pretty rare. Tumors associated with the nervous system are likewise arising from the populations that *do* divide, such as the supportive cells of the central nervous system (called gliomas, broken down into astrocytomas, oligodendromas...) or the cells that wrap around peripheral nerves (peripheral nerve sheath tumor, broken up into neurofibroma, perineuroma, and schwannoma) or the cells that cover the brain (meningioma).","9":"Precisely that.\n\nFrance here. As it happens, several of my friends run high-end cheese shops in Paris and I've had the chance to visit their installations and ask questions over the years, and OP's question was one of the first ones I though of, as it's a natural one.\n\nDifferent types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses 'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings.\n\nCheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference. This is why you can take a non-mature goat cheese, say a Crottin de Chavignol, and finish it several different ways to produce different outcomes, depending on what the shop owner, who in France is often a professional cheesemaker him\/herself, wishes.\n\nBut at the end of the day, cheeses are matured in extremely controlled environments, since the wrong type of bacteria can make or break an entire batch of cheese, so while temperature and humidity control are paramount, cleanliness and protection from random bacteria is crucial as well.\n\nOP, if you ever travel to Paris or any other place in France or Italy that produces cheese the traditional way, do know that most cheesemakers and cheese shops will gladly let you visit their setups.","10":"It’s really amazing how much there is to growing plants… \n\nPersonal anecdotes:\n\nBoss got us a bunch of plants in my old job’s office, and we distributed them around, pretty much like “oh, this one looks great over here!” We also assigned daily watering duty, and even weekly “leaves care”, when we would spray water on the leaves and wiped off dust. \n\nFast forward a few months, some of the plants did great, while others looked almost dead. Boss took the almost dead ones home and put them on their porch like balcony (rooftop apartment), and they came back to life!\n\nSome more research was done, and we realized that (as a rule of thumb) big leaves means the plant is probably used to grow in low light under bigger trees, while small leaves means they need a lot more daylight.\n\nBack into our office the plants go, and we put the small leaves ones near the window, and the big leaves ones more central, where they couldn’t get as much light.\n\nOnce again, some of the plants do great, while others are absolutely miserable! We call in boss’s wife, who brought the “dead” ones back, and she does a bunch of research and decides we need one person to care for the plants who knows all this shit, instead of rotating plant duties.\n\nI was the plant guy for about 6 months, and I was told so much stuff - and I still killed one of the little trees by over watering. There is so much to consider. General things like don’t spray water on the leaves when they are in direct sunlight, check the soil humidity before watering, don’t leave plants in direct sunlight when the indoor temperature can go above 38C (summer weekends, when the AC wasn’t on), etc. and of course the more detailed things like “this one does not like water on the leaves, this one needs a fairly dry soil, and this one can only be approached while singing its ancestors’ song”.","11":"These answers may be correct, but they do not have much linguistic basis.\n\nBabies are born with systems that help them learn language. One of these is Universal Grammar. Universal Grammar is the idea that all languages share the same grammar basics, and everyone (apart from those with extreme language disabilities) is born knowing those basics. This is a widely accepted theory from the famous linguist Noam Chomsky.\n\nHowever, the system has to be “powered on”. Babies need exposure to language in order to actually develop language. They “know” the basics, and, in their early years, babies are immersed in one or more languages. This way they learn vocabulary, and they “tweak” the Universal Grammar concepts they know to the languages they hear around them.\n\nParents correcting mistakes doesn’t really mean anything. There have been studies done that show that young children don’t really benefit much from corrections. There is a theory called the “lack of stimulus theory”, proposed by Plato (if I’m not mistaken): how can all children master their native language in the same way, if the exposure they’ve received is wildly different? Not all parents are equally involved in speaking to their children, not all parents use the same grammar structures and vocabulary. What happens with bilingual children, who often get half the exposure to each language that their monolingual counterparts get?\n\nI’ll reply to this comment with two ELI5 examples.","12":"Most of the highly upvoted comments here are wrong.  The premise of the question is wrong.  If you dove to the bottom of the ocean you would not implode.\n\nAs the pressure rises, the air-filled spaces in your body would get smaller.  Your lungs would shrink down, so your ribs would move inward like they do when you exhale.  Your sinuses and inner ears would fill with water.  \n\nBut that’s it.  Most of your body is incompressible liquids and solids, which will not get smaller under pressure, so they will not move.  *Physically*, a human sent to the ocean floor will look just fine.\n\nHowever, they will be dead, because *chemically*, the biochemical reactions that keep us alive work differently at high pressure.  Oxygen and nitrogen become toxic, our cell membrane reactions change, etc in ways that are subtle, not well understood, but deadly to us.\n\nDeep sea organisms don’t have pockets of air in their bodies, so the pressure has no physical effect on them, and their biochemistry is adapted to work fine at high pressure.\n\nA good demonstration of the fact that physical crushing is only caused by shrinking pockets of air is that humans can [free-dive](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Herbert_Nitsch) from the surface to twice as deep as the crush depth of a [World War 2 submarine](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gato-class_submarine) without injury.","13":">when you eat an orange, doesn’t it pretty much immediately separate into (1) juice and (2) a small hunk of fibrous stuff in your mouth as you chew? \n\nYour premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed. Fiber slows the process,  thereby reducing how fast your body is absorbing the sugar in whatever you consume. This is the key here. Juice is just a liquid already broken and processed. It passes through much quicker and everything in it will be absorbed much quicker. This can lead to a rapid rise of you blood glucose since nothing is slowing down the absorption . This spike results in a rush of insulin production and release to make sure your body is absorbing and converting the glucose flooding your blood into fat and storing it for use later. If this happens to often and frequent you can develop whats called insulin resistance. which is what it sounds like. your body stops responding as well to its own insulin, which now means it can regulate your blood glucose level well. and now your enegry and metabolism is all over the place. Left unchecked this results in type 2 diabetes.","14":"Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That’s 165 ºF \/ 74 ºC. The appearance and texture will be different due to the difference in myoglobin and fat content. The higher fat content in duck meat makes it juicier and more moist compared to chicken. The higher myoglobin content will make it look more like what we associate with medium rare from steaks.  \n\nThe chance of chickens carrying food borne pathogens like Salmonella is higher than that of ducks because of how chickens are farmed compared to ducks. Much more extensively and in more crowded conditions. That means the meat has a higher chance of being contaminated when the bird is slaughtered.  \n\n*Bonus ELI5: Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein similar to haemoglobin. It’s predominantly found in muscle cells and serves as a short-term store of oxygen. Birds that fly long distances would have lots of these in the breast muscles to help supply the oxygen needed for flight.*  \n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards, kind ELI5 friends!","15":"I have an explanation for this. It is the squad keying method of modern combat. Modern combat keeps the keying of the person within one key and for all combatants the designation of the friendly is the key of C and associated and the enemy to be determined lurks outside of C. The egress point from C to the enemy in B is the resolvation G from a one or two bar of C. The common way to do this yields that people are fatter and taller especially, as the method yields octave resolvation which ultimately expand the keying of the person on a time basis towards being quite tall and weighty towards the end of the phase, and especially smaller at the beginning of the phase as the method starts with a single squad member, C2 or C3.\n\nFor example, progression 1X12-9X15 yields directly 1X12X24 which is the resolvation and it is this psychoacoustic effect which yields that people are taller towards the end of the phase of the music as these resolvation have gone through multiple iteration thus have tended the end of the phase to be taller, which this is also fatter if the resolvation is not done correctly. If the resolvation tends towards power chords, then there is less weight gain that happens therein. For example resolvation 5X12X24X29-1X12X24X36-7X19X31 there is weight loss which happens on the third term and it is this method which yields strength training from keying.","16":"Great question, and love the answers. I started running 3 years ago, ran my first full in 2022, and three fulls in 2023.  It’s amazing watching your body become more efficient at something like running. For me, the resting heart rate was the most noticeable.  The funniest story was I went for a physical for work. The nurse takes my pulse, and looks at me confused. I asked if everything was ok. I could also tell she was fairly new to nursing based on age, and a few little things she did. She just responded with “uh yea…. I’ll be right back, just going to get the doctor.”  She comes running back in with the doctor. He introduces himself, she whispers something to him. He looks at me, chuckles, and says “long distance runner?”  I confirmed, and he turns to her and says “it’s ok, it’s common for them to have a lower heart rate, their bodies are very efficient”.   Second would just be an overall body recomp.  Training for marathons, if doing it right with proper fueling, you don’t lose weight, and sometimes even gain a couple of pounds, but your body still changes quite a bit and becomes more solid and muscular. I always tell people that if you want to lose weight, stick to less miles, not more. For me, I use the off-season to shave a couple of pounds, and usually stick to 6-8 mile runs every other day or so.\n\nWith the above said, please reconsider that rigorous of a training schedule. Most people following that type of plan end up injured (myself included).  When I started running, I fell in love, and was running everyday, building miles. Couldn’t wait to run a full marathon. A few months later, I was sidelined with a foot injury. It takes at least a year to build your body into handling that kind of endurance, and beating. You may get through it unscathed (and if you go for it, I hope you do), but it will be a miserable experience, and most likely will leave you not wanting to do it anymore. In any which case, it’s an amazing feat to run that distance.","17":"The language you speak has far, far more impact on the way you think than you probably are even aware of. It helps you internalise your thinking and make sense of your experiences.  You can reflect on things that just happened and analyse the past to learn and grow, and also can comprehend that a future exists and begin to understand how it could pan out. \n\nIt alters your perception of literally the tiniest experiences, and I mean not just knowing language, but people who speak different languages think differently because of the way their brain processes information. Also being outside of human contact would mean zero social skills and missing out in probably 99.9% of the learning needed to exist in modern society. \n\nHumans learn mainly through social experiences and observing others first, especially during formative years, either their parents, siblings, peers, strangers in the street, characters on TV etc. \n\nThe human brain has a huge capacity for learning, but it can’t do it without some sort of facilitation. When we learn, the brain actually PHYSICALLY changes in shape, known as neuroplasticity. \n\nI could go on about this topic for hours.

Chromosomes, hormones, external genitalia, brain structure, etc. merely correlate with sex.  \n\nWhat is dispositive of sex in anisogametic organisms is being the kind of organism which produces, produced, or would have produced if one's tissues had been fully functional, [either small motile gametes or large immotile gametes.](https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093%2Fmolehr%2Fgau068)\n\n> Why are there girls and why are there boys? We review theoretical work which suggests that divergence into just two sexes is an almost inevitable consequence of sexual reproduction in complex multicellular organisms, and is likely to be driven largely by gamete competition. In this context we prefer to use the term gamete competition instead of sperm competition, as sperm only exist after the sexes have already diverged (Lessells et al., 2009). To see this, we must be clear about how the two sexes are defined in a broad sense: males are those individuals that produce the smaller gametes (e.g. sperm), while females are defined as those that produce the larger gametes (e.g. Parker et al., 1972; Bell, 1982; Lessells et al., 2009; Togashi and Cox, 2011). Of course, in many species a whole suite of secondary sexual traits exists, but the fundamental definition is rooted in this difference in gametes, and the question of the origin of the two sexes is then equal to the question of why do gametes come in two different sizes.","19":"Great question! Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced\/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so i know a thing or two. \n\nYour body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called , and sugars are mostly  broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva.\n\nYou know that feeling of your mouth watering when you look at\/smell something delicious? That's the first stage of digestion preparing itself for the work ahead. \n\nIf you want to check saliva amylasis in action, try a piece of something you wouldn't consider sweet, but contains carbs - a piece of bread for instance. Hold it in your mouth and let it get saturated with your saliva. In a few seconds you'll start feeling a sweet taste in your mouth - that's sugars from the bread being broken down and absorbed into your body.\n\nI tried to keep it as simple and as through as possible, but if any professional would like to add anything, feel free to comment :)","20":"You're right about most dairy products being only pasteurized except for UHT milk in those box containers, and most cheeses have a low enough water activity measurement that they do not need to be heat treated after packaging. I believe though that mayonnaise is a commercially sterilized food so even though it is not in a 'can', it is still considered a canned food. It has to be because it is basically egg white, oil, and water. I could be mistaken. Ketchup is weird because the salt\/sugar content may make the water availability too low but I believe they are commercially sterilized (which isn't the same thing as 'sterilized'). Mustard again is weird because mustard itself has antimicrobial properties inherent in it, so again, it may not need heat processing. Many foods not packaged in a can are still considered to be canned foods because they have undergone commercial sterilization. Sometimes foods can be irradiated instead of heat treated. There are USDA Standards of Identity on everything from canned corn to pickled beets. These are briefs on each product describing exactly what the product IS and how much of anything can be in it and still be called that. These standards are why 'cheese' is different from 'cheese spread' which is again different from 'cheese product'. They all have standards of identity which include how much % of actual product vs additive or 'filler' may be in a product as well as how much feces or insects can be in it in parts per million. There are industry standard time\/temp charts that must be followed for commercial sterilization and pasteurization as well as USDA and FDA inspection and testing of product. This testing often includes sampling and incubating product to measure and test spoilage.","21":"So where I am, it is specifically advised for parents to sleep with their infants. No hospital I’ve been at has detached cribs for healthy newborns, they all have co sleeping beds. You get advised on safely bedsharing (no drinking or drugs, no smoking, bed has to be made up in a particular way etc)\n\nFrom what I understand is that most data relating to the dangers of cosleeping is old - locally this means that much higher rates of SIDS are assumed in these studies than currently is a reality = an exaggerated overall risk. \n\nSecondly and in no particular order, some of the most common risks for SIDS are smoking parents (78%), drunk parents (23%), prone positioning of the child (27%), exclusive bottle feeding (65%). Nearly all SIDS cases present with at least one of the above risk factors, excluding bed-sharing. \n\nAdditionally, groups get conflated - babies which are bottle fed at night often get conflated with exclusively breastfed babies for instance, as well as babies who died to SIDS who usually sleep in cribs but were put to sleep in their parents bed just on the night they died (which may be associated with factors explaining this out-of-norm decision like particular parental exhaustion). This is relevant because we know that babies who don’t usually sleep in their parents bed have a significantly higher chance of dying of SIDS when they do then sleep in their parents bed, then those who habitually sleep in their parents bed. Differentiating between the two is more common in modern studies, but didn’t use to be the case. Babies also have a much higher chance of dying of SIDS if they bedshare with someone who is not their parent.\n\nLastly the percentage of SIDS cases per live births a year is 0,00003%. Even if the risk of SIDS is 5 times higher cosleeping without any additional risk factors (which given the data of those being present nearly all time is unlikely), that puts the risk while cosleeping at 0,00015%. Nevertheless, it’s still in an increase is risk - so why do it? \n\nCosleeping can aid in maintaining the sleep of both the infant and the primary caretaker, often the breastfeeding mother, leading to less exhaustion. It also means nightnursing takes place in an environment prepared for sleep, and there’s leas of a risk of falling asleep in a nursing chair or on the couch, which does have a much higher risk of SIDS. Habitually sleeping with an infant in bed also means the bed is typically prepared and adjusted for that situation, unlike when you just take the baby into a bed made up for adults (thick duvets, pillows) because you’re exhausted. \n\nWhen a parent is in a particular state of exhaustion however, or drunk, or has taken sleeping pills, or is a smoker, the baby is at a high risk for SIDS. Whether that’s the case on principle however around here anyway isn’t considered proven.","22":"Usually it’s a cardiac event. \n\nOld people sleep a lot. Sick people sleep a lot. So when an old person goes to sleep because they’re not feeling well, it’s usually chalked up to them just being old. \n\nOften times, the thing that kills them is the thing that is making them not feel well. So they go lay down, fall asleep, get worse while they’re asleep, and then they’re often found deceased when they don’t wake up from their nap \/ in the morning. Increased fatigue is a hallmark sign of cardiac involvement. How do you fix fatigue? With a nap.\n\nMost of the Dead On Arrival’s we made (EMS) were between the hours it 9am-noon. When people are usually awake, but today, they weren’t. \n\nNatural causes is a coroner’s term, not a medical term. Often listed on the death certificate. In the absence of a single, known cause, it’s usually ruled as natural causes. As long as it isn’t suspicious, criminal, or otherwise “weird,” the coroner isn’t going to put in for an autopsy. They’ll rule it natural causes and release the body to the funeral home. \n\nThe death certificate is a legal document. It has to be reasonably accurate. Especially when a crime or accident occurs. Imagine a homicide but the death certificate states natural causes. Now the defense has a leg to stand on stating that the victim did not die as a result of their clients actions. That’s a problem. \n\nMost medical deaths aren’t going to court. So “natural causes” is good enough. \n\nInsurance also plays a part. Life insurance may have certain stipulations in which a certain cause of death may not be covered. Some policy’s don’t cover suicides within X months of taking out the policy. Some policy’s only cover certain causes of death (a scuba diving accident being covered by specific scuba diving insurance). Some policies exclude certain causes of death (aviation accidents not covered for pilots).\n\nELI5: When you’re not feeling well, you say you’re sick. You don’t always know exactly why you’re sick, just that you’re sick. You could go to the doctor to figure it out but that costs time and money, and it’s not usually going to change much. Sometimes it does when you need medicine, but that’s a special occasion. When you go to the doctor and figure out what you’re sick with and to get medicine; now you’re not just sick, you have strep. \n\nWe don’t always know why people die. We could figure it out, but it takes extra time and money. Most of the time, finding out exactly what it is doesn’t change anything. Sometimes it’s a special occasion and we need to know why they died. When that happens, it’s no longer just natural causes. It’s something else.","23":">so then why wouldnt it turn into something more useful like dense muscle with all the training their doing?\n\nIt does, these guys are absolutely packed with dense muscle.  If you ever see a strongman after they lose weight (Thor and Eddie Hall are good recent examples) they're absolute units.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for the \"gut\".  It's normally not that large a layer of fat, their cores are absolutely packed with muscle to stabilise them through the lifts they do, with a healthy layer of fat over the top.  It makes their midsections disproportionate. \n\nThey're also training usually for 4+ hours a day, it makes sense for them to keep a calorie surplus, which can lead to fat gains.  Bodybuilders \"bulk\" too when they're training, then they go through quite a severe cut and dehydration to reduce their body fat % for competition, strongmen and powerlifters (specifically in the higher classes with no weight limit) don't. \n\nThere's also a bit of a scaling issue, most of these guys are *huge* - they're giants.  They're massive even after they cut down, it's not all fat, they're just big blokes.  They're always going to look bigger than a normal reference human, especially given their unusual proportions.","24":"People's DNA determine how they handle foods and poisons. So does their diet.

Having more copies of this gene means I don't get as drunk by alcohol (I process it three times faster). 23andMe call this \"less likely to drink coffee\", because I don't get stimulated by it. \n\nSounds great, but P450 makes Acetaldehyde from ethanol. Which is waaay more toxic than ethanol. It's causes inflammation in joints, and the brain. To process it, humans need lots of vitamin B6, and cysteine (used to make some proteins). Approximately a daily dose of B6, and 2.5g of cysteine, per beer. Before I knew this, I would get horrendous hangovers, because I'd need to drink more than most, to get drunk.\n\nKnowing that, I have drunk 20 beers in a session, with regular doses B6\/cysteine, every two beers, and done a 10km run the next morning, no hangover.

Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage.\n\nBacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere.\n\nThere are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth.\n\nThe second big thing to remember is that all living things are essentially just chemical processes. You put two molecules next to each other and things start to happen.

Skin doesn't work like that.\n\nHuman skin is filled with glands that produce oil constantly to keep our skin healthy; remember that we are basically bags of slightly salty water, we need a waterproof covering to keep the inside in and the outside out. Furthermore our skin grows from an underlying layer pushing the old layers outward. Your surface skin is dead tissue that gradually abrades away. If you brush against something you are losing small amounts of dead cells, not living tissue. Remember that living tissue requires blood to reach every cell, so if your surface was composed of living cells you would be constantly oozing blood!\n\nAll this means that when you step out of the shower your skin still has quite a bit of oil still on it, and is instantly exuding more. You wipe off the water with a bundle of fibers that abrade small amounts of dead, oily skin tissue which is then trapped within the moist fibers of the towel.

There was no science behind the target of 5 by the way, it was chosen as a nice easy to remember number and obviously eating veg is good for you generally.  If you have good kidney function and aren't ill or sweating loads, you don't necessarily need 2 litres of water. \n\nBasically the requirements are different person to person. For example my wife drinks about 3-4 litres a day and has done for years. I drink 2-3 cups of hot drink and day and that's it. Her kidneys are used to her regime, mine are for mine. If I drink a glass of water I'll need the loo within the hour easily and will need to go again within the next hour. Obviously if I do strenuous exercise it's different.\n\nBear in mind a significant amount of water intake is actually in the food you eat.  And if you take certain nephrotoxic medication such as ACE inhibitors or chronic NSAID then you are more at risk of developing kidney issues if you don't drink enough.\n\nOne of the things I often see at work (critical care unit) is people giving loads of fluid to patients and they pee litres. All they are doing is getting rid of excessive fluid and then people think \"oh, big urine output, we need to give them loads of fluid to stop them getting dehydrated\". Yes, in certain circumstances that may be needed but not always.\n\nIn short if you are healthy, you can probably drink to thirst and be fine, rather than drinking to an artificial numerical 2 litre target. (Yes, thirst can sometimes be a late sign especially if I'll or heavily exercising but I'm talking regular day to day).","29":"So a good bit of answers here but what you’re looking for is the reservoirs.  While people are getting that it’s a retrovirus and inserts its DNA into cells to infect them, it’s not like cells have infinite life.  \n\nEffectively we have antiretroviral medications that target different steps in the process where HIV binds to and hijacks our cells.  That includes preventing it from attaching to cells, keeping it from insert its DNA, etc.  these drugs fall into different classes and generally most cocktails (most people take three drugs in one pill but there’s some exception).  The standard backbone targets reverse transcriptase, then that’s paired with a protease inhibitor, a fusion inhibitor, an integrase inhibitor, etc.  \n\nEventually after we keep it from replicating long enough you reduce the amount of free virus in the blood below the level that our current PCRs can detect them.  That’s where we get the term undetectable. \n\nBUT that refers to the blood.  The cells within the blood will die off eventually and get recycled by the body so eventually you’ll really have a tiny amount in the blood.  That means eventually you’ll also deplete the HIV infected white blood cells, which when they get recycled means you’ll reduce it in things like semen and other bodily fluids.  That’s why undetectable people can’t transmit HIV (we now say that with the weight of fact behind it, we don’t say “reduces the chance” anymore).  \n\nBut there’s part of the body where reservoirs can live like lymph nodes and microglial cells.  Antiretroviral drugs don’t generally pass through the blood\/brain barrier so while you’re eliminating HIV from the blood, there’s virus still elsewhere in the body that can reseed the body should the medication go away.  We used to hope that we could eradicate after long enough treatment (in the order of 20 years) but that’s how we learned about these reservoirs. \n\n(I’m an epidemiologist and work with HIV pretty exclusively)","30":"I've done eye therapy so I've actually done eye exercises 🤣\n\nMy doc called one exercise \"pencil pushups.\" I had to focus on a pencil, then far away and back again over and over.

One example was when I looked at a digital clock it would split in two, a lot like what you see in the movies when someone asks you how many fingers am I holding up in there drifting around in circles. \n\nAmong other exercises, one of the exercises was to look up close at a pencil a few inches from my face and then look far away. I had to do this repeatedly over and over again and I could only switch back and forth once I maintained clear focus on the pencil or a Faraway object. After lots of sessions and hours upon hours of exercises until my eyes hurt from the workout, they began to get better.\n\nI still had glasses for years afterwards but eventually my optometrist got me to where I don't need glasses anymore, and years after that I now have 20\/15 vision. \n\nExercises won't fix your eye lenses,  but you can strengthen your ability to focus and your binocular vision convergence.  You can improve the speed and ease of focusing with exercise just like working your biceps. However...eyeball workout fatigue feels different than what you're used to, lol. It's a weird feeling but you'll feel tired and like you can't focus on anything, because, well...your focusing muscles are tired! \n\nYour eyes focus by flexing muscles that change the shape of the lens in your eye, so if those muscles are weak, focusing is more difficult,  generally speaking. There are also muscles that control eye movement;  strengthening those and training your eyes to converge properly helps for those who have double vision problems like I did. I'm not a doctor but from my limited understanding these are basic healthy things to work on for some people.\n\nI'm a fan of exercising my eyes by looking at different distance objects,  reading far away signs,  not looking at screens without breaks for too long, blinking regularly, and looking around  with my eyes more often, rather than turning my head as much.","31":"So there’s a few things going on here:\n\n1. Skill. Lifting weights and moving stuff are both different skills. As you do each of them, they become easier. While they do use muscle and strength, there’s other stuff happening to do the job. \n\n2. Lifting generally used more of a certain type of muscle, we’ll call it fast twitch. And labor jobs use this slow twitch more. Running many times a week is okay, and it also uses more of this slow twitch. Fast twitch is more heavy stuff, but not as much. \n\n3. Companies do not care about you and physical reperire labor will injure you over time. \n\n4. You CAN workout more than every 2-3 days. You just need to regulate it more. Some people squat or bench 5+ times a week. But they don’t go super hard every day. They might ONLY squat or bench. \n\n5. If you workout in a gym, you tend to put more stress on other stuff like your nerves. Squatting a bunch of weight like 500lbs takes a long time to recover from if that’s your max. \n\n6.  Conditioning. You ever do a sport? Tryout weeks were always the hardest because most people aren’t used to running and moving around so much. But after a while our bodies adapt. \n\n7. Different goals. A bodybuilder or powerlifter wants to put on muscle and strength gains. A digger just wants to get better at digging. Sometimes larger muscles will be a detriment because it will make you hotter (more mass) and tire you out more in the summer. \n\nLastly, just an FYI muscles do NOT take 2-3 days to recover. Each muscle group is different and takes different amounts of time to “fully recover”. It’s sorta like asymptotic curve. But that’s why if you’re a powerlifting and have a competition coming up, you go much lighter for the week coming up, and even the weeks before are sometimes a bit easier. If you really wanna push yourself, you need a longer “rest” than 2-3 days to find your 1 rep max. I say “rest” because you’d still workout but with much less volume and intensity.","32":">I experienced it with my baby, you can almost feel the oxytocin surge through you when you do it.     \n      \nI mean I had skin to skin immediately after birth, all the good stuff, no separation from baby, and I just felt absolutely nothing. Tired, numb. Sort of ‘oh a baby, how sweet’ but nothing more.   \nI actually did bleed quite a lot as well and my milk production was very low so could be related.    \n        \nI had some pretty severe pre-natal depression and some bad experiences leading up to the birth, so I think I maybe just wasn’t capable of it on a neurological level.    \n     \nBut then I also know other women who say the same thing - that they were around all these narratives of ‘when you see\/hold your baby it feels amazing and powerful’ and just found that wasn’t the case for them. Despite from a practical perspective everything being the same. It’s useful for new parents to know that also not having these feelings is relatively common and therefore ‘normal’, and the vast majority of these women go on to have loving relationships with happy children.    \n        \nI love my daughter with all my heart, and we’re definitely bonded now, but it wasn’t a ‘from day dot’ thing at all. Took a while to bond with her really.   \n     \nI am due to have my second in just over a week, so it’ll be interesting to see if I get that feeling this time or it’s just not a me thing.","33":"Stains aren't the same thing as plaque or dirt. Staining is in the tooth like dye on cloth, not on the tooth like paint on a wall. One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea\/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel. \n\nTeeth need to be whitened with something that can oxygenate the enamel and allow the bleaching effect to take place. That's why most at-home whiteners like Crest White strips or whitening mouthwash contain hydrogen peroxide in the formula, as do most professional whitening solutions available from the dentist. \n\nThese formulas open the enamel \"pores\" to oxygen, but this also leaves teeth vulnerable to sensitivity. Some people will experience pain which is why professional strength treatments are only available by a dentist's prescription. They need to monitor how you are doing and make sure you don't hurt yourself, you'd be shocked what some people will endure for vanity. \n\nIt's not just coffee or tea either. We had a patient who's whitening wasn't working and her teeth were turning a strange pale purple ish color. We figured out it was because she was ignoring the \"no colored beverages\" rule. She kept drinking bright red and blue Gatorades & somehow didn't think of them as being a colored beverage. Basically we we giving her a solution to open her enamel and she was pouring dye right in there! She had to pay for even more treatments as a result. \n\nAt my old dentist office we would need to encourage people not to keep whitening because the teeth were starting to look unnatural. Nobody naturally has paper white teeth, I would tell them, \"no lighter than the whites of your eyes if you want the teeth to look real\".","34":"The placebo effect is complicated and difficult to study. Unfortunately, it's not possible to make any absolute and certain statements, since this is an area of ongoing medical research. We can only say what seems currently likely.\n\nRelatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that \"established\" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean.\n\n\"Regression to the mean\", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better. Even if they have a disease that is permanent and the body can't fix it, people have ups and downs within that context; and they tend to be going to get treatment when they're in the \"downs\".\n\nThere does appear to be some amount of small measurable effect. It's strongest in subjective measures; in particular, in pain. This makes sense as the *experience* of pain is fundamentally a neural phenomenon, something that is happening in the brain. It is well known that mental state significantly affects pain - it's why people can ignore pain during a fight, for example. Things like stress, comfort, etc. have a major effect on pain.\n\nThere's little (but not zero) current, verified evidence that the placebo effect can significantly affect \"physiological\" issues.","35":"Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. Before germ theory, people believed in Humorism or the four humors. They were yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit.\n\nTo anyone who finds this interesting: there’s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels. When it separates, you see the dark clots at the bottom (black bile), the red blood cells above that (regular blood), the white layer of white blood cells (phlegm) and the yellowing serum on top (yellow bile). \n\nEdit: it was also used as a kind of personality test, depending on which humor was naturally more dominant in your body!\n\nPhlegm: Low spirited, forgetful, reserved, calm, quiet. \n\nBlack bile: Lazy, fearful, sickly, depressed, sensitive, moody. \n\nYellow bile: Short tempered, daring, ambitious, aggressive.\n\nBlood: Friendly, like to joke. Spirited, social and active.","36":"I’m the OP, and I want to note I haven’t downvoted you like others.\n\nThis place was an actual preserve. All of the elephants that live there have been rescued from tourist attractions, work operations, or (in very rare cases) were born there and were with the troop they’d been born into. \n\nThey do allow a very limited number of, highly supervised, guests–who pay—because it costs money to maintain such a preserve. There are no elephant rides, no elephants trained for photos (at least not by anyone at the reserve), and they were allowed to roam free across the many hundreds of acres available.\n\nMoreover, a lot of the elephants there had been subject to severe abuse in their earlier life. As one example, one elephant had a deformed leg after having stepped on a land mine at an illegal logging operation it was used for, before the preserve rescued it. Another had been abused so severely at the circus from which it had been saved that it would frequently refuse to eat.  Neither of those two elephants would survive in the wild.\n\nI agree that, in an ideal world, all elephants would live, independently, in their natural environments. Sadly, largely because of humans, some require human assistance.\n\nThat human assistance requires resources. I have no regrets or qualms about paying to get to walk through a nature preserve, seeing those amazing elephants, to keep that preserve up and running.","37":"You need the vitamins and minerals that get lost through metabolism and urine. Additionally amino acids cannot be fully recycled so you would need to add those as well, or the body will take apart muscle including the heart muscle to obtain those amino acids (protein = multiple amino acids).\n\n\nIf those 3 points are met, then yes the obese person would only starve once their fat storage runs out. Depending on degree of obesity, this will take over a year.\n\n\n\nWithout those vitamins, you will develop conditions like scurvy within a couple of months (hair falls out, wounds don’t heal, old scars break open) as well as other vitamin deficiency disorders.\n\nIf you do not provide sufficient quantities of minerals, including regular table salt but many others, it will only take weeks at max before you die from most likely heart arrhythmia, because those minerals like sodium and potassium are required for all nerve signaling and with too low (or too high) levels the heart stops working.\n\n\nSo supply the vitamins, minerals and minimum amount of protein\/amino acids in the drink, then the person would indeed survive for as long as their fat storages last.\n\nSince fat has 9kcal per gram, or slightly less in actual body fat, that’s around 3500 kcal per pound of fat.\n\nSo with a fully sedentary lifestyle, you could use about 1 to 1.5 pounds of body far per day.\n\nIf you are 100 pounds overweight you would go 70-100 days before your body weight reaches ‘normal’ levels, and another 30-60 daya before your body has no more accessible body fat and starts using proteins from muscle etc to turn it into glucose for energy, at which point even with now sufficient food there’s a high risk of death.\n\n\nSomeone who weighs 600 pounds, could go about one and a half years easily, assuming as always, micronutrients and minimum quantity of amino acids are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you just dumped an average weight person and an obese person on a deserted island with only fresh water to drink, their life expectancies (on average) would not be drastically different, as the lack of minerals and water soluble vitamins would occur nearly independent of body fat.\n\nIf you had some minor sources of food, the obese person would potentially be able to last longer (depending on the amount of minerals and vitamins they are able to find)","38":"They are actually quite successful at what they are trying to do, replicate\/reproduce in order to be spread to others. \n\nThere are several virus that we term “common cold” it’s not just like a single virus type that is responsible for the small colds we get each year. If you think of a virus like Lego pieces, maybe Virus A has blue and yellow blocks that attach to our green blocks and make us sick my replicating, until our body discovers putting a blue block on top of our green block stops Virus A. \n\nBut then, you’ve given Virus A to 10 more people who’s bodies have to also go ahead and figure the solution to Virus A. \n\nEach virus goes through this, and eventually when Virus A circles back around to you, maybe it took 6 years for your body to forget that a blue block on top of green stops Virus A, and then Virus A reinfects you all over again.\n\nOr…\n\nMaybe Virus A replicated so much that now instead of blue and yellow Lego pieces, it has a green piece that sticks to your green piece and now your body doesn’t want to put the blue block onto it like before, and maybe that little change makes Virus A put you in bad shape, and you spread that new Virus A.1 to 35 people, who continue to spread that. \n\nNow keep in mind that was all for a single virus that can cause the “common cold” symptoms, but there are so many of these little virus’ that the next time you get the common cold like symptoms, it’s likely your fighting an entirely different virus.\n\nEdit: a virus’ objective is just like any species objective on this planet, continued replication to perpetuate its existence. In fact, a successful virus is one that doesn’t outright kill its host at all, that’s actually an unsuccessful virus.","39":"We have a lot of systems that make us extremely good distance runners. \n\nHorses do have an edge on us and can out-distance us, if only partially because we've spent centuries breeding them to be exceptional at marathon running. \n\nFor us the factors that give us an edge are:\n\n* We can sweat and don't have a lot of fur so we're pretty efficient at cooling\n* Fabulous leg muscles\n* Bipedal motion keeps our lungs and heart able to function separately from our running\n* We are capable of \"anaerobic respiration\". That means our cells can keep producing energy (albeit less efficiently) after the oxygen in our blood isn't sufficient to power them.\n\n(First off, we have to talk about people in decent shape. Being out of shape kills most of these advantages.) \n\nThe sweating, horses are pretty good at it too. They have a coat and that hurts them a little. But again, we've bred them to be dang good at regulating their temperature. Compare this to dogs, or deer, or other animals we think of as pretty fast and they will overheat long before a human will if the human's focused on endurance.\n\nOur musculature and bipedal motion keeps our lungs and heart separate from our running. If you've heard a dog at full sprint you'll probably notice they seem to breathe in rhythm with their steps. That's not an accident, it's biology: their body's muscles squeeze their lungs as part of running so they HAVE to breathe that way and it means they run out of oxygen much faster than we do. Lots of 4-legged creatures are like that, but some of them are more efficient about it.\n\n(That's even worse for creatures that don't sweat: panting is a way they cool down but if their breathing is restricted they'll be even LESS efficient.)\n\nThat's what makes anaerobic respiration a great secret weapon. Our lungs aren't getting squeezed and influenced so much by our running, but we still can't bring enough oxygen in to run full-tilt for very long. But at a point where another animal would collapse due to insufficient oxygen, our body *keeps going*. This is less efficient, and creates a lot more waste that fatigues us more, but for a persistence hunter it means we can have a few seconds of extra speed after we see the prey falter a little so we don't lose sight of them and can approach casually because they're done. \n\nCombine that with our intelligence: even if we lose sight of prey we can train ourselves to track them and find where they've hidden to make them run again. That's sometimes methodical and we'll cool off much faster than they will. \n\nSo a horse\/human comparison's tough. But also a marathon race is over when someone reaches the end. The kind of competition humans are best at is, \"Who passes out from exhaustion first if you get to choose your pace?\"","40":"This thing is called a [hypnic jerk](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hypnic_jerk).\n\n\nFrom wikipedia\n\n>Physically, hypnic jerks resemble the \"jump\" experienced by a person when startled, sometimes accompanied by a falling sensation. Hypnic jerks are associated with a rapid heartbeat, quickened breathing, sweat, and sometimes \"a peculiar sensory feeling of 'shock' or 'falling into the void'\". It can also be accompanied by a vivid dream experience or hallucination. A higher occurrence is reported in people with irregular sleep schedules.\n\n\nYour \"why question\" is hard to answer.\n\n>Around 70% of people experience them at least once in their lives with 10% experiencing them daily.\n\nRegarding cause, research says \"we don't know really.\"\n\n>According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, there is **a wide range of potential causes**, including anxiety, stimulants like caffeine and nicotine, stress, and strenuous activities in the evening. It also may be facilitated by fatigue or sleep deprivation. However, most **hypnic jerks occur essentially at random in healthy people**.\n\nI remember having them a few times in my life, and I drink 3-4 pots of coffee (30 cups) most days.  If caffeine was a cause I would expect to have them more.","41":"> Now why aren’t we putting vitamins and anti-oxidants in the water too? They’re definitely good for us.\n\nFluoridation makes sense for reasons that are largely specific to fluoridation. It's important to understand that fluoride already occurs naturally in many sources of drinking water. In fact, in some places, the natural mineral water contains significantly *more* fluoride than is recommended to reduce tooth decay, and the excess is removed. Basically, the recommended levels of fluoridation are known to be generally beneficial, and are known not to be harmful, and are well within the bounds of what might be found in nature anyway, and the fluoride is cheap and fluoridation is easy.\n\nThis is a pretty unusual confluence of factors. Why should we expect the same to be true of, say, Vitamin C? Most people get more than enough of that anyway and would not benefit at all from adding it to water. Like most vitamins, it's a far more complicated substance than fluoride, and I suspect that it would be very expensive and possibly impractical to get enough of it into the water supply to make a difference for people suffering a deficiency. It's acidic, so it would tend to make the water more corrosive, and it might noticeably affect the flavor. And who knows about the ecological implications?\n\nI can't possibly talk about *every vitamin*, even leaving antioxidants aside. The point is that there is no reason to expect that the case for fluoridation, which is narrow and specific to that mineral, should apply generally to any other random thing.","42":"Once the baby is born, the placenta, which used to be stuck to the wall of the womb to help get nutrients from mother to baby, will detach and come out of the mother’s body naturally, usually within about 15 minutes. Once it’s detached, the blood flow stops, and it dies like any other organ that’s been cut off, and no longer does anything to help the baby. If left alone, the cord will slowly dry out, but it’s easy to irritate the stump caring for the baby and could cause an infection, think like how you can get an infection by picking the skin around a scab too early, only a baby is a lot more likely to get one.\n\nIt’s routine to clamp and cut the cord once the baby has taken its first good breaths, been cleaned off a bit, and had a few minutes to have some skin-to-skin contact with the mother to prevent this risk, after that blood flow has naturally stopped, unless there’s an emergency and one of them needs to be moved away for medical care.\n\nIn the past, it was policy to clamp and cut as soon as possible after birth, as delayed cord clamping can increase the risk of neonatal jaundice (a buildup caused by a chemical produced by the liver not getting out of the blood fast enough that makes their skin turn yellow), but nowadays, it’s very easy to manage that with light therapy, especially since most people see a doctor pretty fast, even if they didn’t give birth in the presence of a doctor, to make sure that everyone is healthy after the birth, and all doctors, nurses, and midwives who deal with newborn babies check for that routinely.","43":"Eli5:\n\nHorses grew up with wolves and bears, which you can run away from if they get kinda close.\n\nWhile horses are big and strong, they're just big softies that are really good at running away from things if they get scared or upset.\n\nThat means if you can keep it calm, it will be a big softy, and if you fall off one or spook it, it will try to run away.\n\nSince horses like to run away from things, we can put them on a very long leash or in a large, round playpen, and just let them run around while we are nearby until they say \"okay, people aren't that bad.\"\n\n\nZebras on the other hand grew up with lions and crocodiles and other fast-attack ambush hunters. If a Zebra is a big softie, it gets eaten.\n\nThat makes Zebras very, VERY mean. If you scare a Zebra, it will turn around and bite you and kick you until you want to run away instead of it.\n\nSo if we put a Zebra on a long leash and try to make it run in circles, it will just start trying to step on you.\n\nSame thing happens if you try to ride one and you fall off.\n\nSo it's just really really difficult to become friends with a Zebra.\n\n(Non Eli5: the way we break horses is essentially through simulated persistence hunting, if we try this with Zebras, they'll just turn around and kill us).","44":"This is actually something of a mistaken assumption that gets the logic backwards.\n\nScientists have done studies that show that people lose the most heat through hands, feet, and head in very cold situations *while dressed for the cold*. They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything. Your core\/torso is actually the place where you would lose the most heat if it's exposed, but it's very easy to layer up your torso with multiple layers of clothing, insulating it well. Meanwhile, you sacrifice significant dexterity in your hands by wearing even one pair of relatively thin gloves, and going beyond that rapidly diminishes utility. Likewise, your feet have to fit into your shoes\/boots so you can't just wear six pairs of socks, and it's difficult to fully shield the face from cold exposure without also blocking your vision. There also tend to be more gaps, i.e. between your sleeves and your gloves, between your pants and your shoes, and between your collar and your head covering, which gives an avenue for heat to escape.","45":"I think this is a bit of an over generalization. Yes some shoes are extremely narrow for the sake of fashion but these are typically shoes meant to be worn for shorter periods of time like high heels or maybe a narrow men’s dress shoe. Most every day shoes are not cramming people’s feet into tiny little spaces. If your shoes are doing that, you need to either move up a size or find a different brand. People also naturally have different sized feet. My feet personally are very narrow and don’t have an issue with really any shoe unless it’s actually too wide. Some people have wide feet and many brands offer wide width varieties of their shoes. You also got this information from a commercial which is trying to sell you a product so of course it’s going to bash other shoes so that it can sell you it’s own “natural” shoe. To ask why all shoes are extremely narrow to the point of altering peoples foot shape is just not an accurately phrased question. If everyone’s foot shape was being painfully altered by their shoe, you’d hear a lot more about it. Most people are fine with the shoe they wear because they find the shoe that’s comfortable for every day wear. Some shoes are uncomfortable yes but uncomfortable doesn’t always mean “foot altering”\n\nEdit: spelling","46":"Different apes are specialized for different things. Chimps and orangutans and bonobos are arboreal. They need strong, powerful limbs for climbing.  Gorillas spend more time on the ground, but need to be able to physically repel predators. They also walk on their arms, a high effort activity. \n\nHumans are specialized in.. well, a lot of things. Humans have less muscle mass and hair then other great apes relative to body size, but in return can stay cool while jogging over long distances. Our arms can't easily haul our body weight up a tree or be used for walking, but can accurately throw things, build tools. Once humans started building tools natural selection greatly preferred the most nimble, flexible hands and arms that could make better tools, and larger brains that make better tools. \n\nHumans are weaker because our hands are hyperspecialized for making and manipulating tools. Long, fragile, sensitive figures and muscles made to make very small, accurate motions. Sure, you can't punch like a gorilla, but no other apes can make a ship in a bottle. \n\nOh, and as to your main question: All other apes lose muscle mass and flexibility just like humans if denied exercise. This has been tragically proven with apes in captivity.","47":"I love this topic. I am a lady with WACK airways that I've been working on for a few years.  I'd love to share this as I understand it! \n\nYES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: \n\n* Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva.  This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected.  CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it.  Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. \n* Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander.  When you mouth breathe, your tongue is down and you're not wearing your bio-appliance.  Over time, without this spreading force across the roof of your mouth, your face will begin to stagnate in its width, then eventually even collapse inward. The floor of the sinuses is the roof of the mouth, so a narrow mouth will lead to...\n* Breathing problems: the more your face collapses, the less room you have to breathe through your nose and the more difficult it becomes.  Which leads to...\n* Missing out on nitric oxide.  You produce a powerful anti-inflammatory chemical in your sinuses that helps your body calibrate to how much inflammation it should have at any given time.  If you don't nose breathe, you're NOT delivering this mood-calming, inflamation-soothing chemical to your body every single breath that you take the way you could be.  (Which leads to more inflammation, which leads to more breathing probelmems, which leands to more mouth breathing which leads to ...\n* Sleep disorders: OSA = obstructive sleep apnea.  If your airways are tight and your mouth is open you're going to start having your airways literally collapse on you when you drop into the deeper stages of sleep.  When I had OSA (which has been rectified through surgery and airway dentistry -- as shown in my in-lab sleep studies) I lost my memory and was falling alseep everywhere.  Which can lead to...\n* Car crashes\n* Heart disease\n* Strokes\n* Basically all terrible ways to die. \n\nSo, if you CAN breath through your nose, DO breathe through your nose.  If you CAN'T USUALLY breathe through your nose, ironically, try irrigating the sinuses with saline spray and hten taping your mouth at night.  You can always take the tape off if you need to, but this actually works for most people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you CAN'T AT ALL nose breathe, see a really good ENT and an airway dentist, preferably, who work together. \n\nGood luck, my friend!","48":"It's the thousands of hours of repetition of a few movements that wrecks people. This is unlike sports.\n\nVery few people who train for any sport work out in anything approaching a 40 hour week. Professional athletes can be quite stingy with how they use their bodies, and many running records were set by people who figured this out first. Notably Roger Bannister's four minute mile was run on [five hours of training per week](https:\/\/runningmagazine.ca\/the-scene\/the-surprisingly-simple-training-of-the-worlds-first-sub-4-minute-miler\/) in 1954. Today, the 100m record holder Usain Bolt is famously unwilling to run very much. Bolt holds about half of the top 20 all time 100m best runs.\n\nMeanwhile few sports run year round. Variety and off seasons are built in.\n\nWith workplace physical labor, you get incredibly consistent use of a few movements, often under heavy loads, multiplied by years of force against cartilage, connective tissues and bone that degrade over time. Worse, when mildly injured, most tradepeople work through it. Taking a week off for a bit of inflammation is unlikely, while athletes understand this is worth the investment in recovery time. So small things go unaddressed and compound over time.\n\nDiet and stress are also a likely contributing factor.\n\nBeing sedentary is bad for you. You should get some light steady cardio activity, you should get some weigh\/resistance effort, you should get occasional high intensity intervals. Good for the heart, bones, lungs, metabolism. But you should also rest regularly, and take time off when injured.","49":"Dentist here long answer incoming. Perio is highly complex. It’s not just that there is bacteria, it’s that your immune system attacks the bacteria to prevent you from getting an infection. The bone gets caught in the crossfire. Once the bone drops away the gum follows. \n\nReducing the bacterial load reduces the chances of perio disease, however some peoples immune system is super sensitive and will cause perio even with smaller amounts of bacteria, while others will brush minimally and their immune system doesn’t freak out.  I have a patient who is the most meticulous person I’ve met and her hygiene is clearly as meticulous, two of her back molars were lost due to perio. I have other patients where the only time bacteria is disturbed is when I drill their teeth to do a filling and their bone is as solid as rock. \n\nUnfortunately once bone is lost from perio it is difficult to restore, the more common treatment is to keep the teeth as clean as possible by having them professionally cleaned more often to reduce the bacterial load (Generally ever 6 months, but could be 4 or 3 in patients with perio). But please don’t think it’s all a wash, perio can stabilize with good preventive care and even with bone loss the tooth can be solid in the socket (non mobile). \n\nAlso. Antibiotics will help in the short term but as soon as you stop taking them bacteria will come back. So you’re back to step 1 and the antibiotic likely gave you the shits. The exception is minocycline which some dentists will place in the gums to treat a certain area, but even then it wears off after about 14 todays and this localized dosage is pretty expensive.\n\nEdit: Grammar. Had a few adverbs that were too dramatic, made things more concise.","50":"Life, as best as we can tell, needs to exist in a solvent that’s strong enough to allow for incredibly complex chemistry and yet won’t dissolve the molecules that make up the organism. If life is carbon-based, water’s really the only solvent that fits the bill. And while it’s technically possible that there could be life that’s not carbon-based, it’s probably unlikely. This is for reasons to do with the fact that the complexity of life requires a lot of very long molecule chains that are stable for a sufficient period of time for life to, y’know, live. The way carbon forms strong covalent bonds with itself means it can form molecules like DNA in a way that other atoms just can’t. And even the few elements that can, like silicon, don’t form long chains that are anything like as strong or as stable as carbon’s molecules. \n\nFinally, the three most common atoms in the universe are hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Helium doesn’t form bonds, which means the most common molecules in the universe by volume are hydrogen bonded with itself, H2, and hydrogen bonded with oxygen, H2O. Water is a solvent that’s perfect for life, and it’s many orders of magnitude more common than any other candidate solvent. So while we can’t say for certain that carbon and water are the building blocks of extraterrestrial life, it’s statistically MUCH more likely to be carbon and water than it is to be any other combination.","51":"First, the way that probiotics support your health does not require colonization. In the past it was believed that you would take probiotics and those would “grow” inside your GI tract and that was it. Although we still have a lot to learn, we now know that most probiotics (if not all) don’t actually colonize (remain) your body. They only remain there for as long as you take them. In medical school we don’t really learn that much about probiotics and a lot of research is fairly new so a lot of doctors just now basic information on them. We now that the potential benefits might be due to different mechanisms; the potential of certain strains to produce certain chemicals (post-biotics), their direct competition with our microbiome, interactions with harmful bacteria and other microorganisms, and other mechanisms. So each probiotic blend would be different and those mechanisms don’t depend only on numbers (Colony forming units), that is why currently Probiotics should only be the ones which include bacterial strains that have clinical studies showing that they provide a certain support, in those studies they use different concentrations and the one that provided the best support would be the one to be taken. Many products say; “Lactobacillus rhamnosus” or other name, that is not enough, you want to know is it the LC705 strain? Or the PEL5? Or which one, and what studies does it have. In conclusion; comparing CFU’s is indeed a bad way to compare probiotics, but the explanation by your doctor was not correct. \n*conflict of interest: I am a physician and I work for a company that develops probiotics.","52":"Wild horses who can't cope without them die :)\n\nBut the rest of the answer is - it's multiple factors. The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. \n\nThe second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet and legs that a wild horse would only experience rarely.\n\nSelective breeding for traits like height, strength, and speed, may also lead to weaker hooves if that's not the main focus of the breeding (where in the wild, weak hooves are selected OUT pretty quickly because horses that can't comfortably travel can't survive)\n\nLastly, domestic horses may \"need\" shoeing to improve \"performance\" - to help encourage them to lift their feet higher or move in more even fashion, etc.","53":"They DO check. It boils down to: it depends.\n\nYou have to divide people into 2 groups. People with chest pain, and people who don’t have chest pain.\n\nIf you are having chest pain when you’re walking, going up stairs, etc, then you might be at risk of a heart attack. You might get imaging tests like a coronary CTA or nuclear stress test or exercise stress test.\n\nIf you are not having chest pain, which is basically the entire population, then there are step-wise ways to risk stratify people, because it’s not feasible or useful to run every single test on every single person. It costs a lot of $$$ and it’s not utilitarian to do 1 million tests to find only 1 patient. \n\nYour risk factors for having a heart attack are many: age, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, family history of heart attacks (“my dad had a heart attack when he was 48”). If you check off multiple of those boxes you might get a coronary calcium score CT which is an imaging test. If that’s normal then great. If it’s abnormal you might get pushed up into the same category as people with chest pain, and get more imaging tests like a coronary CTA or nuclear stress test or exercise stress test.\n\nSo when you go to your doctor for an annual physical and they ask you:\n\nAre you having any chest pain lately?\nAre you exercising?\nHas anyone in your family had heart disease?\nAnd they check your blood pressure.\nAnd they have you get blood draws for hemoglobin A1C, fasting glucose, cholesterol.\n\nThese ARE the stepwise ways in which they’re picking out who is at risk of heart attacks and who to do MORE tests on.","54":"Hemostasis or the stopping of the flow of blood, is managed in a number of ways.\n\nAs an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is  essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination). The band is then left in place to prevent blood form flowing into the leg and thus from bleeding into the surgical site.\n\nAnother way hemostasis is maintain, is through Electrosurgery, commonly referred to as bovie. The use of an electromagnetic current plus the electrical resistance of soft tissue  generates heat, this is use to cauterize small bleeding vessels, like the type you would find just below the surface of the skin.\n\nLigature, or simply using a suture material to tie off 2 ends of a vessel and cutting between those to ties. This is also done using other materials like staples, clamps, etc.\n\nHemostasis is also maintained though the use of drugs. Epinephrine works by constricting, or making smaller, blood vessels. Smaller blood vessels will clot off easier on their own.\n\nThen there is simple anatomy. Take an open abdominal surgery for example. The surgeon will first have to reach the abdominal cavity in order to perform the intended surgery. This means first going thought the skin, abdominal fat (like the omentum), facia, abdominal muscle, and the peritoneum (the membranous sack lining the abdominal cavity). The vessels that supply blood to these structures are generally quite small and easy to control bleeding using the methods i mentioned above. Then once inside the abdominal cavity the surgeon identifies the organs and their respective atrial and veinous structures and avoids them.","55":"Like everything in fitness, this is either an reasonable or unreasonable amount of protein depending on your goal and personal attributes. Calculators usually overestimate your protein goal a fair bit though, so it’s up to you to decide on your own a bit. You probably do not need that much, but that being said it doesn’t mean you won’t benefit from that much if not more. If you are working out hard, in more bodybuilding style workouts looking to gain as much muscle mass possible, this isn’t an unreasonable amount of protein. Or if you’re in a calorie deficit looking to shed fat to reveal as much muscle after a bulk it still is reasonable, as higher protein diets help against losing muscle in a calorie deficit. But if you’re not really bulking super hard or in a deficit, and you’re working out moderately, you can still make progress with less. Especially if you’re not only focused on muscle mass alone \n\nI’m skinny and tall but muscular, (6”2 70kg) and am bulking and workout fairly intense, i eat 3800\/4000 calories a day and eat on average 210g of protein per day, the amount i eat daily makes it quite easy to get said protein goal. Things like salmon, beef mince and a protein shake here and there go a long way.","56":"As an audiologist I recommend against this. It’s not (just) because you could pop your eardrum. You shouldn’t put anything in your ears if your goal is to take wax out, because that doesn’t solve the problem you’re trying to fix. Inevitably you will pack at least some wax further down. If you pack it too far down, it becomes impacted and can’t be naturally expelled like it should through the outward growth of the skin of your ear canal (from deep to shallow, like a conveyer belt moving wax to the surface). These archimedes-screw cleaners are just as likely to impact wax as a q-tip is. If you don’t have an expert looking into your ear to check, how do you know you didn’t just pack wax down further?\n\nIf you are worried about wax buildup, first know that a thin coating of wax in your canals is normal and necessary for good ear health. It has a slight antipathogenic effect and helps prevent infection of the canal. If you want, you can help the natural process of wax expulsion along by flushing a small amount of water in each ear when you shower. Alternatively, an over the counter solution like Debrox or generic equivalent (carbamide peroxide) is safe, effective, and won’t do any harm unless you’ve got a hole in your eardrum. And above all else, if you really are worried about wax, see an ENT physician for a full assessment and ear cleaning.","57":"If it is not plausible , no.\n\nThe main points here is that smooth muscle is not trainable, the way skeletal muscle it.

Doing it cautiously without killing you. \n\nYou're basically a big fragile bag of various salts and water and you gotta pour in and drain out the right mix at the same time without allowing the bag to form wrinkles or tear else you're disqualified from the game of life. Remember to praise your kidneys for regulating your ability to be a hydrohomeboy.\n\n\nOverall, it depends on a few things: new (acute) or been like this forever (chronic) plus how far off is your blood from normal concentration.\n\n\nThe key in every case is to identify where your \"normal\" is and aim to get you there safely in a reasonable timeframe, else we shrivel up and kill your brain and other stuff in the process like seizures, heart stuff, etc.\n\nIf your blood is severely diluted from normal, we check your blood electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, etc.) frequently and probably will give you some tasty salty water through an IV. Care is taken not to correct your sodium concentration too fast else it will cause a lot of problems (e.g. osmotic demyelination syndrome). Other electrolytes can cause other problems but I'm just gonna talk about sodium.\n\nIf it ain't as severe and you have time on your side, we employ a variety of techniques depending on a few things like - how concentrated with other stuff are you? Do you drink a lot of beer and alcohol? you taking meds? how much fluid\/water is in you? are your kidneys actually working? \n\nThese things include:\n\nDiuretic medications. The dreaded \"water pill\" will make you pee like a race horse. Your blood can't be full of too much water if you pee it all out.\n\nStop drinking water. A true hydrohomie knows there's more to water than just the water. \n\nTaking in salt is a little tricky because \"water follows salt.\" People tend to forget that. Remember that super salty meal that you ate and now your hands and feet feel puffy full of water? Ever notice how salting meat pulls out the liquid? Adding salt can potentially pull in more water into the mix.\n\nThese are just a few of the things we can use to fix what people do to themselves.","59":"I'm going to try a little more ELI5 answer:\n\n *The body will definitely and quickly try to throw out the baby with any contaminated bath water.*\n\nLet's say you're out ~~of~~ at picnic and out of nowhere you see one ant.  You know one ant isn't going to throw off your entire picnic so you kind of just ignore it and you just let it pass by without letting it harm you. We could probably see the same for five ants, 10 ants, 15 ants etc so let's just metaphor carry until the next paragraph.   \n\nNow imagine that 2 ft to the left of your picnic is an ant hill the size of a small apartment building.  And all of a sudden those ants have now infested your picnic because you were reading this text post on Reddit and not covering up your food.  \n\nWhat are you going to do now? You could certainly try to start killing ants one at a time but you realize that your picnic is now just overwhelmed and infested.  \n\nLet's say you have a fire hose.   What do you think is the best option, continuing to fight it one at a time or just fire hosing the hell out of all the water which may mean you lose any food that was at the picnic but you're sure as heck going to try to drown every single ant at once.  \n\nSo that's what your body does when it comes across contaminated foods.  Explosive diarrhea is one method that your body uses to  flush everything out of your body at one go with every ounce of water you have in your body at one time in one acute episode.   Basically whatever's in your stomach at the time that your body calls red alert will  be flushed out at one time.  The end result of that is what we call food poisoning because our body has been poisoned by some sort of contaminated food and the response of the poisoning is to evacuate all personnel from the stomach area in an attempt to scuttle the contaminant.  \n\nIt's safe again traditionally when you've rehydrated yourself from the episodic explosive diarrhea which basically drains your body of every ounce of water that you have.   That's what Pedialyte is for rehydrating yourself with electrolytes and basically very mild saltwater to replenish the all hands on deck that your body called for to evacuate and abandon stomach ship. \n\nI remember one fascinating fact that Mr Miller my 10th grade high school biology teacher who I'm pretty sure was a transvestite but that's really not important to this story but it is an interesting memory is that he told me that the answer to the question for what you do when you're both constipated and having diarrhea is the same. Both are symptoms of you being dehydrated and the solution is to just drink the hell out of water.","60":"Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.)\n\nBegamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. \n\nThe functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,( e.g.  xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful molecules, for example, converting Tyramine (found in certain foods) in foods into dopamine. \n\nUnlike many of not most enzymes which perform a very specific chemical reaction or a narrow class of related reactions, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are more general purpose oxidation catalysts. They're heavily involved in the detoxification amd elimintaiin of Xenobiotic compounds found in our diet (mainly, in plant foods.). They are also involved in the breakdown a processing of a wide range of medications. \n\nEating a fair amount of grapefruit or grapefruit juice acts to inhibit these enzymes. This means that either the liver and kidneys become unable to break down and eliminate the drug from the body (causing it you become much more potent to a dangerous degree or causing side effects to become much more severe.) Or else after taking a pill, the liver won't efficiently convert it into it's most active configuration, making the drug ineffective. \n\nCertain kinds of drugs rely on the liver to metabolize them in order to be effective for two reasons. The first is that the active form may not be able to pass easily through the intestinal-blood barrier thus would otherwise need to be given by injection. So taking advantage of these enzymes allows it you be taken orally in pill form. Another reason is that giving the inactive form as a pill allows you to take much more of the medication. Since it's activity is controlled by the rate the liver metabolizes it, this means that the dose lasts much longer. As in a day or two rather than a few hours.\n\nThe reason that Grapefruit contains Bergamottin doesn't have to do with humans. The compound is believed to promote resistance to attack by Fungal pathogens","61":"Your blood pressure is higher than the water pressure.\n\nThat's basically the short version.\n\nWhen a hole between two liquid containers is made, effectively connecting them, the liquid flowing through that hole will be from the higher pressure container to the lower pressure container.  In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container.\n\nIncidentally this effect is also behind why when the city water supply has been shut off for a while, then turned back on, the water always comes out of your faucet a bit discolored (yellow or brown) until you let it run for a while.  And you're usually told not to drink it until you've left it on for a while to flush water through the system.\n\nThere are always leaks in a city's main water pipes at the joins where they turn corners or split in two.  It can't be helped.  But most of the time you don't need to worry at all about the leaks because the pressure guarantees the leak goes OUT OF the pipe, not INTO the pipe.  But, if the water pressure is turned off for a while, then that stops being true.  The goopy mess of dirty water that was created when the water pushed OUT of the underground pipe into the surrounding dirt now flows backward through the leak back into the pipe once the inside of the pipe is no longer under pressure.  Thus when the water is turned on again that gunky stuff that leaked into the pipe has to be expelled back out of the pipe again.  After that, the pressure will ensure again that the leak goes in the correct direction - out of the pipe not into the pipe.","62":"Symbiotic gut bacteria is a big part of it. Gorillas have bigger large intestines than us, and a gut microbiome full of different bacteria that help them to break down cellulose into glucose and derive energy from it (something we can no longer do, cellulose is indigestible insoluble fiber to us, although we still need some in our diet to keep our digestive system working properly), as well as to get all the necessary amino acids (which are what we get from eating protein, as they are what we ourselves build proteins out of) and vitamin B12  from their plant-based diet (although they also get some of both from supplementing their herbivorous diet with insects like termites). The reason we as humans can’t survive off of a diet of almost entirely leaves and fruit in the same way is that we’ve lost most of the necessary gut bacteria as our ape ancestors became more omnivorous (because you can just get all the essential amino acids and B12 easily from eating the meat or eggs of pretty much any other animal), as well as our hind-gut (large intestine) shrinking considerably and mostly losing certain structures that provided a home for some of those helpful microbes (including our appendix, which used to be a larger organ called a cecum, but now it’s atrophied we’re not exactly sure what it does, it might serve a minor immunological function still?).\n\nThere’s also a difference in our teeth; adult gorillas have 32 teeth just like us, but they have gigantic molars compared to us, and their larger jaws are better able to accommodate their last pairs of molars (“wisdom teeth”) than ours often can (hence why, with dentistry, we most often tend to remove ours; they’re literally more trouble than they’re worth for us), and they use these to finely crush up plant matter so that they can get the maximum amount of nutrition out of it (whereas a lot of the fruits and vegetables we eat go partly undigested, because our teeth just aren’t as uniquely adapted to eating that stuff anymore, due to our diets having become more diverse, and our ancestors’ jaws shrinking as a result, which may have also helped us evolve the capacity for speech).\n\nI believe the guts of gorillas are also better at absorbing plant-based sources of iron than ours are.\n\nThis is why in plant-based diets in humans, large amounts of whole seeds (which don’t make up much of the diets of gorillas, as most of seed-based foods like grains and beans are something we get large supplies of via agriculture) are required for the nine dietary amino acids we need for protein, and supplementation for iron and B12 (interestingly, supplements for the latter are created using bacterial bioreactors, meaning that we basically have machines doing for us what gorillas and a lot of other herbivorous mammals have going on in their hind-guts naturally).","63":"There's a combination of reasons. The most significant one is that cheese mold itself usually isn't dangerous. Most varieties of mold that commonly grow on cheese just changd the flavor. They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content. And if you have a hard cheese like cheddar, and it gets wet and then molds, it's also not safe because of the moisture. Then soft cheeses like Brie, you'll get opinions both ways. Some people say it's safe if you cut off a good inch or two. Some say it's not safe at all. I would not eat moldy soft cheese. The third thing is density. The more tightly packs the cheese, the harder it is to penetrate. Moisture helps get deeper and produces more dangerous mold, and that's why even hard cheeses that are tightly packed are still dangerous they get wet, even if it's just moisture from condensation in your fridge. \n\nAll that said, even if you cut off the moldy part of hard dry cheese, if you eat the outside of that cheese, you will likely ingest some mold. Which brings me back to my first point, that cheese mold usually isn't that dangerous. If you have hard dry cheese and it had black mold, or gray molds throw it out. If it's green or blue, you can cut it off and safety eat it, but you might notice a difference in flavor.","64":"This is called Fisher's principle.\n\nBasically in species that reproduce like humans, the sex ratio automatically go to a 50\/50 split.\n\nThe thinking is if anyone in the species had a mutation that would result in more offspring of one gender, that would make the other gender have a greater chances of finding a mate and make having children of that gender preferable to pass on your genese.\n\nWhenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender.\n\nSo like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle.\n\nThat said 50\/50 is not the real ratio in humans.\n\nIt is just the approximate ratio of humans during their main reproductive years.\n\nHumans actually are born with slightly more boys than girls, but because boys die more than girls that is whittled down to parity by the times it comes to making babies. Men also don't live as long as women so after they age when human normally have children, women become the majority.\n\nThe rate at birth is also not fixed, but can be affected by outside factors (epigenetics). Under some circumstances like famines etc the ratio at birth might swing more towards having girls than boys for example.\n\nAlso with humans there are social factors not present in animals, like couples that keep having children until they have a boy, abortions infanticide.\n\nIt should also go without mention that not all humans neatly fit into the boy or girl categories.","65":"Many of these answers are not really answering the question. Some are just plain wrong.\n\nTaste is a neurological process involving the stimulation of certain nerves. In this case, specialised cells on our taste buds.\n\nMany different types of nerve cells, or neurons, become activated or excited by chemicals or compounds when they come into contact with receptor sites on the neuron cell's surface. This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed. If it's too \"quiet\", not enough of the food to taste, or it's bland, we may not taste something if it never reaches the threshold.\n\nSo what does this have to do with salt? Some neuron cells have what are called gated channels on their surface. These gates 'open or close' more depending on how much of a certain substance comes into contact.\n\nFor example, sodium or salt, can cause these ion gated channels to open up really wide, and as a result, the cells fire messages a lot faster\/stronger, and creates a stronger flavour message. The chain reaction of the flavour message that follows on to the brain is therefore much \"louder\".\n\nPut simply, Salt works as an amplifier for neurons in your taste buds, so it literally enhances the neurological sensation of flavour.\n\nMind you, salt also has it's own flavour that we find desirable and pleasant. So it works on two levels. Increasing the reception of flavour in the food (not necessarily changing the foods flavour itself), plus it adds the salty goodness we also like (which many have pointed out we have an evolutionary desire and requirement for).\n\nThis is also one of the reasons why putting salt on a wound hurts like hell. It causes neurons to fire their messages much more strongly because the cells receptor channels are much more open.\n\nEdit: I want to postface that this certainly is not the single answer to the question. I'm no expert. Salt does all kinds of things at molecular and physiological levels - but thank you for the award!","66":"Hi there.\n\nsimply put, you have two chemicals that either speed your brain and body up, or slow them down. GABA slows it down, glutamate speeds it up. They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis)\n\nAlcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain.\n\nToo much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops.\n\nIf you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't stop, which will eventually make you stop breathing because the muscles can't coordinate.\n\nEdit: the vomit reflex tends to happen too late to stop the absorption of alcohol. Most of it is very rapidly absorbed from the stomach, not the intestines like most food. If you're too drunk to clear your airway then it can obstruct it and suffocate you.\n\nEdit: I am incorrect in saying that it's mostly absorbed in the stomach, only about 20% is. The rest moves to the small intestine where it is rapidly absorbed. Thanks u\/jean-luc-7432 for pointing that out.","67":"Because evolution doesn't work that quickly.\n\nSo this video is relevant.

Based on how food is readily available today, things like OMAD (one meal a day) or 24 hour\/48 hour fasting intervals is probably the better option unless you're an elite athlete who regularly burns thousands of calories a day.\n\nOur ancestors, for the record, wouldn't have been elite athletes. They'd be conservative about using up energy save for a hunt, nomadic movement, etc.\n\nI'm going to add stuff here for people who seem to lose their minds each time someone brings up fasting. Much of the processed foods that we eat mess with our hormone receptors.

They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site.\n\nBefore about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries.\n\nSo there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment might possibly be a) known and b) useful. Otherwise it's a trope used for humor, and fair enough! Childbirth is intense and in fiction those scenes can often use a little levity. An observer panicking and being sent to overenthusiastically boil water is very relatable! An anxious observer aggressively demanding 47 times if the doctor is doing his job right is just annoying, even if that's more realistic.","69":"Many of the comments are focusing on errors in cellular replication, which is certainly part of the process which contributes to aging and development of cancer.\n\nHowever, if you look at causes of death globally, cardiovascular disease is leading. This is because inevitably arteries become filled with plaque and calcify. This can be accelerated by factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, smoking tobacco, suboptimal diet, and high cholesterol, to some extent it also occurs inevitably as part of the aging process due to wear and tear on the arteries. The body does not have a completely effective way to remove the plaque that builds up and reverse calcification. These blood vessels become narrowed. If there is narrowing in the coronary arteries, the heart can become weak, leading to heart failure.  The narrowing can also affect the electrical activity causing the heart to become more prone to arrhythmia. If a coronary artery is completely blocked, that is a heart attack. If there is occlusion of an artery in the brain, that is a stroke.\nAt a certain age (usually 80-90) the arteries become too brittle to be able to effectively place stents to reestablish blood flow, and there are only certain areas that can be stented to begin with. The arteries becoming narrowed throughout the entire body leads to poor blood flow, eventually causing deterioration of all organs throughout the body.","70":"Your tissue is made of cells, which are basically tiny living things.

But also any bacteria that was trying to get in your body stops being impeded by your immune system. So that starts moving in and breaking things down too, leaving behind toxins.\n\nWe can certainly use machines to make the heart beat and lungs move. That will get your circulatory system running. Through this alone we can keep a person \"alive\" long after brain death. Brain death is the one we can't reverse. Your brain is what keeps things going subconsciously, and it's also what gives you your conscious mind. We don't have a way to kickstart that again because we still know basically nothing about how it works. \n\nIt's kind of like the heart\/lungs are a car. We understand internal combustion engines and even if you had an ELI5 explanation of them you can sort of reason how to get one started if its normal starting system isn't working. Compared to that the brain is an *alien spaceship* with engines so advanced we can't even figure out what the fuel is. We can *reason* that there's probably a way to start it but we lack enough knowledge to figure out a safe way to do so. \n\nAnd there's a time window to all of this. If too many cells die and take damage, the stuff we do to keep the heart\/lungs going won't work because they'll have taken too much damage. It's kind of like how if a car's out of gas you can still make the engine parts spin, but if you can see part of the engine has exploded you know no amount of work's going to make it run again.","71":"There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake himself up during the night so he can exercise to get his heart rate up again. Otherwise, he could die in his sleep. \n\n\nEDIT: AI fact check: \n\n\nThe story you might be thinking of is about Marco Pantani, a legendary Italian cyclist who had severe bradycardia. While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal.\n\n\n\nHowever, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night. While there are reports of him occasionally using a stationary bike at night to manage his condition, it wasn't a regular practice. In fact, he preferred training outdoors during the day.\n\n\nHere are some key points to clarify:\n\n\nPantani's bradycardia was a medical condition, not typical for all cyclists. Most cyclists, while having lower resting heart rates than average, wouldn't experience such extreme bradycardia.\nHe didn't use an alarm specifically for nighttime exercise. His training usually happened during the day.\nWhile occasional nighttime exercise might have been part of his management, it wasn't a primary or regular practice.","72":"Starting in the early Edo period, a new Yokai (Demon) appeared in Japan: the [Korori](https:\/\/monster.fandom.com\/wiki\/Korori?file=Korori.JPG). A tricky monster that breathed a foul breath spreading an invisible sickness that afflicted entire households and sometimes took whole villages.\n\nWe call it Cholera today, and the 1862 outbreak in Edo killed hundreds of thousands. It was brought entirely due to contact with traders from the west.\n\nBut of course it didn't have the same total devastation effect that was seen in the Americas and there are a number of reasons for this.\n\nNative Americans were uniquely susceptible to diseases from Eurasia because their immune systems were primed differently than Eurasian people's. Specifically, when your immune system is developing your body can specialise in creating cells which are either extremely effective against microbes \/ infectious diseases, or against parasites like hookworms and tapeworms etc.\n\nNative American immune systems were heavily primed against parasites, and weak against microbial diseases. Eurasian and African peoples, thanks to millennia of animal domestication and exposure to the many plagues that have swept across the continents are much more capable of dealing with microbial infection. So even in cases like Korori, you are looking at a group of people with a much better toolset to deal with that type of disease than the Native Americans had.\n\nThis is also why Europeans struggled where Native Americans didn't when it comes to disease. The stereotype of the \"lazy southerner\" comes mostly due to the fatigue side effects of the [hookworm infections](https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/nova\/article\/how-a-worm-gave-the-south-a-bad-name\/) that were shockingly widespread in the US even into the 20th century.\n\nedit: added links","73":"The liver's primary job is to make compounds in your blood take on a form that's easier for the kidneys to excrete; in practice this means making them more soluble in water. All in all the liver is about making things you want more available to you, and making wastes easier to excrete. The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and the stomach, it's the first pass which tries to balance everything in a way that works for your body. The liver breaks down large molecules into smaller and more easily absorbed ones as well, it does a LOT of different things really. The liver is also involved in producing bile salts, recycling compounds from our own dead cells and more.\n\nYour kidneys can be thought of as the other end of that sort of job, the kidneys (ideally) filter your entire blood volume a couple of times an hour. One of their primary jobs involves regulating the concentration of electrolytes and water in the blood. The kidneys also remove the waste products we generate as a result of metabolizing proteins, it's how we eliminate a lot of excess nitrogen. The kidneys can only do a large part of their job though because the liver is there to make compounds dissolve more easily in our body's water. \n\nFinally, although you didn't ask, the last line of waste removal is through feces, where the wreckage of old blood cells, undigested food (and lots of the corpses of bacteria which live in our guts), old bile salts and whatever compounds the liver couldn't make soluble enough in water to be eliminated by the urine.","74":"Molecular oxygen is only relatively stable. It's better for those oxygen atoms than being by themselves, but they *really* want some extra electrons, and are basically fighting to gain possession of the other atom's.\n\nThere's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it. One big strong oxygen can take care of a single molecular hydrogen too. Its a pretty great set up for both of them. So when molecular hydrogen and oxygen get to hanging out, it tends to be pretty explosive.\n\nMolecular hydrogen, however, is pretty rare here on earth--its often tied up with either a happy oxygen, or another element. That other atom, carbon, that really likes sharing its electrons--its got 4 that it loves to share. \n\nSo that oxygen molecule would be a lot happier if it could find some hydrogens, or if a carbon would come cuddle up and make it carbon dioxide. It would go from relatively stable, to really stable.\n\nTurns out, this stability also releases a lot of energy. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are so happy with this arrangement, they're even willing to do it in steps and involving other atoms and molecules, letting some really wild chemistry happen as they go. \n\nAnd if you do it the other way (by grabbing some energy from some sunlight), you can start taking those carbons out and building molecules with it.","75":"There could be a lot of factors. A lot of hangovers are intensified by dehydration, so it could be that you are good at hydrating and so you don't really feel the real bad parts of a hangover. I used to never get hangovers, and I would always make sure I drank at least two 16oz waters before bed. I slacked on that and I got hangovers. However, my story turns to me getting into trouble with drinking too much, and then those hangovers got to the point to where I haven't drank in almost a year. Some people are predisposed to handle alcohol better than others, but those are the people that are more at risk for alcoholism. When you see someone that can just drink and drink and be fine, that can be a slippery slope to falling into where it no longer becomes fine. Those people are the ones more prone to blackouts because their body can just keep trucking after drinking copious amounts of booze. \n\nGenetics play a a factor in how your body handles converting the alcohol into the toxic stuff in your liver and then your kidneys helping flush it out. So it's very possible that your body is really efficient at that process now, but it's possible as you age your body will have a harder time with it, so you might still be looking at hangovers on the horizon. With anything, keeping an eye on it is key.","76":"lets look at numbers.\n\nSay a kid weighs 25 kg, and an adult weighs 100.\n\n* **To simply move your body the same distance**, the adult expends 4X more energy because they are moving 4X more mass.\n\n\nNow lets look at heat produced.\n\nThe adult's 100 kg body is built and shaped proportional to the 25 kg kid. \n\n* Kids have a higher surface area \/ mass ratio.  They lose heat faster than adults.  This means that **kids burn more energy for producing heat.**\n\n\nLets look at behaviour.\n\nYesterday I sat at work for an extended time.  \n\nHealthy kids probably moved around more than me.

By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume.\n\nThink about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster.\n\nThis can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of the fluid.\n\nHere's are some non-ELI5 links:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4081237\n\nhttps:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/science\/physics\/fluids\/fluid-dynamics\/a\/what-is-bernoullis-equation\n\nPeople wear them while flying on airplanes because they know they're going to be sitting for a long time.

This ELI5 answer misses the point completely.  \n\n\nFirst, the rate of air flow though the sinuses calls into question the claim that they may protect the lungs in any meaningful manner by 'trapping bacteria' (which in itself is a silly statement as sinuses contain a flora of saprophytic bacteria—is it local immune system health that I'd venture to say contributes to sinusitis the most). It would be more apt to say that sinuses protect the lungs indirectly though mucus, if one's pushing that point across.  \n\n\nSecond, going by the logic that sinuses trap harmful substances\/organisms, one might come to a conclusion that we'd better off without having sinuses at all—solely because of the existence of various types of cancer affecting that part of the body.\n\n  \nSo, in my opinion, the actual answer should go like so:\n\n1. Sinuses produce mucus, 'aiding' the immune system.\n2. Sinuses humidify the air (which I'd dare say is a point fair more germane to their purported function of protecting lungs than some 'bacteria trapping'; getting glass particles stuck thanks to dry air for example is far worse than bacteria\/viruses entering a healthy body)\n3. They help the brain (cranial nerves) **cool** down—I'd say this is the most important function (at least according to the anatomists whom taught me), alongside with 4.\n4.

I mean, it only takes a few minutes a day. Regular cleanings, x-rays, and dental checkups are important, but for at least some people, probably not a strict requirement for reasonable dental health if they brush and floss. Remember, a lot of people in the world don't have *any* access to dental care whatsoever, and their teeth are still probably in better shape than the teeth of a prehistoric person. \n\nBut more to your point, you kind of answered your question in your question. As you correctly pointed out. part of it is that we live a lot longer on average now than we used to. Preventative dental care is a lot more important if you're going to live to 80 than if you were only going to live to 50. Also, as you correctly surmised, our diets are a lot different than they used to be. The human diet now has a lot more refined sugars and carbohydrates than thousands of years ago. Refined sugars and carbohydrates are both sticky, which means they stick to teeth and gums, and also ideal breeding grounds for bacteria that can cause tooth decay and gum disease.\n\nSo, it's in large part because we live longer and also our modern diets promote tooth decay more than in the past.","81":"ELI5 version: Virus good at hiding, spreads easily, hard to get rid of. \n\nLong version: The virus has been around since like written history (or so historians say, there's writings of people exhibiting similar symptoms but it wasn't exactly called rabies then). Bats are huge carriers and a big reason why we cant irradicate in the US, but the UK has done a fairly good job at it and a few other areas I believe? Their teeth are also so small, they don't always leave marks.\n\nYou get bit or scratched by a carrier and even there's been inhalation of vapors from bat feces apparently that causes initial exposure. It's an effective virus in that it can be very slow moving as it travels up the nervous system instead of blood to reach the spinal cord and is then spread through there. It can end up in organs (there's been organ transplant rabies cases), it travels to salivary glands (which is a huge cause of spread)  and then when it gets to the brain, it causes inflammation and brain damage. Usually once symptoms start, it's 99% fatal. There have been a handful of cases where people have survived, but most, not all, have usually died afterwards due to complications from it. \n\nA huge problem too, is that rabies is USUALLY the symptoms are not always straightforward and have a wide range, so doctors don't usually think rabies first with symptoms. All the MMWR human rabies reports I've read usually start with some pain in or around the area of the bite and like headaches and just other basic symptoms that could be a miriad of other things. One poor individual kept having ejaculations. Its usually when there's like sensitivity to light, unable to drink water, limbs don't move correctly, or coma that they might think rabies. Its a very sneaky disease. It's ideal host is usually not humans, though thousands die worldwide each year, usually children.","82":"I don't think this is very true. Dogs, cats, and a lot of other land animals are able to swim. Most of them suck at it compared to animals that live in the water. \n\nHumans don't have an \"optional swimming feature\". We instinctively know how to do a very laborious paddle. When people \"learn to swim\" it has to do with training them to be better at it. For example, the body is (usually) naturally buoyant, but if you position yourself certain ways in water you still sink. So you learn things like how to float on your back or how to do a backstroke, which is extremely low-energy. Then you learn specific strokes that help you move faster or use less energy. But a completely untrained person is pretty likely to exhaust themselves and drown in a very short time, mostly because biologically speaking we're not made to live in water so what instincts we have aren't devoted to efficient swimming.\n\nIt's no more \"an optional swimming feature\" as we have \"an optional driving a car feature\". Our hands and feet and limbs give us a wide range of mobility and we have really good motor control. A lot of other animals are similar and can learn to do weirdo human things. For example, some dogs can skateboard. They weren't born knowing how to skateboard. They watched people do it and we've bred them to try and mimic what humans do. They did it and the humans laughed. We've bred them to want to make humans pleased so they learned this was a good thing they should do more.\n\nIt's also notable that one of our [water-in-the-lungs reflexes](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/1987ps8\/eli5_how_do_so_many_people_drown_in_still_water\/ki5ejfa\/) is actually very likely to make us drown, so it's hard to believe that's a sign we are \"supposed\" to swim. This can affect even trained swimmers because it's a *reflex*, it takes over your conscious thought and makes you do things. Our brain thinks we're suffocating and wants us to dig out, which is what you do on land. It does not make us swim, which is what you do in water.","83":"Because they didn't. That's the simple answer.\n\nUnlike many other here, i do not accept that Zebras are just \"un-domesticable\", they demonstrate a lot of traits that would make them prime candidates, they're herd animals, they're herbivores and grazers, they're decently intelligent, and importantly, people have tamed zebras before, tamed, not domesticated.\n\"But they're so aggressive.\" So? A random wolf would either run away or try to kill you, the aurochs were famously aggressive, but among 10,000 or so, you could probably find a pair that was a bit more cool with you.\n\nSo why didn't they? Did you know? The majority of the animals we have domesticated, are mostly from around the last 10,000 years, many of them even from the same general area and the same time period.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nHorses:  modern-day Ukraine and West Kazakhstan - 6000 years\n\nDonkeys: East Africa - 5000 years\n\nCows: Southeastern Anatolia and the Zagros Mountains, Syria and the Lebanon - 10,000 years\n\nGoats: Zagros mountains - 10,000 years\n\nCats: Around  Mesopotamia and Egypt - about 10,000 years\n\nSheep: Mesopotamia - 10,000 years\n\nDomestic Pidgeon: Egypt?  - possibly 10,000 years ago\n\nDogs: Eurasia - 15,000 years (noticeable exception to early domestication.)\n\nChickens: South East Asia - 10,000 years\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is my point? My point is that we as a species have lived for 100,000 years, and only in the last 10% of that time have we actually bothered to try and domesticate animals, and even then, usually it's the same sort of culture doing so, a stable one that's probably experimenting. Had we left people around Zebras for another 50,000 years, they probably would have domesticated them... or made them extinct.\n\nBecause there is another misconception here. History is not a slow march to progress. There is no requirement for a society to be better than the ones that came before them. Many societies throughout history never really progressed, some slipped back. These are people, their main concern isn't some form of progress or scientific endeavor, most likely they prioritized food, warmth, shelter and love.","84":"I've actually heard something very similar. I used to live in a subdivision with a large golf course and when a friend of mine convinced me to wake up at 5am on Saturdays to go to one of the water hazard holes to go fishing (we were both equally as dumb as we were ambitious), we rode our bikes over to Hole 15, wind screaming across the fishing pole line as we hit like 15mph on the downside of hills, and went for it. We did catch some fish, mainly small ones I can't remember, but the spiney-ass carp are the ones that stuck with me.\n\nA year or so later I got a job cleaning the tennis courts and was around a lot because I was also on the swim team and helped with swim lessons for >5 yr olds and became a lifeguard so I ran into plenty of folks, a lot (it was better than home life so that's something). I asked the greens manager about the fish and he said they had stocked the water hazards with those fish I can't remember to help with the algae and water bugs, but they would never stock carp. His supposition was that the birds that flew around our area, another subdivision a few miles away, the small beach area near the pier, and the estuary near us, could've been unintentionally bringing in eggs from other areas and dropping them in our ponds. It's totally hearsay of just a guess, but now that I'm seeing someone else thinking the same thoughts... It's not implausible.","85":"You are right about the vetting and medical training. And there is a flight surgeon for every expedition who monitor each crew members health. Usually the flight surgeon is located on the ground but sometimes one of the crew members is a trained medical doctor and can perform the role of flight surgeon from space. There are quite a well stacked medical cabinets on the space station with various drugs and devices that might be needed. You also have to remember that the ISS is a flying research laboratory where they often do biological and medical research. And the astronauts have a lot of first aid training, a lot of them from before even joining the astronaut corps. So the space station is far from the worst place to have a medical issue.\n\nAs for acute onset problems they will receive first aid by the other astronauts and the flight surgeon. If they find out the condition can not be treated in flight they will suit up and get into one of the return capsules and return to Earth. Not only the sick astronaut but also the other members of that return capsule. There are a number of precalculated possible landing sites all over the world. So they can pretty much return whenever they want. So there is a good chance of getting advanced first aid within the first hour and then to be at a hospital within two hours.","86":"Your body makes a lot of heat on its own. You get frostbite only when the air is so cold your body's heat is not enough to prevent your limbs from freezing. \n\nI don't know if you meant 0C or 0F, but 0C\/32F is not quite enough to cause frostbite in a hurry. If they were sitting still it'd be hours before they were in danger, but they'd probably be a lot less comfortable. They're not sitting still: they're playing a football game and doing a lot of rigorous physical activity. Their body is generating a lot of heat and they probably don't even feel the cold. \n\n0F would be more concerning, but I see charts indicating with a little wind that could still take up to 3 hours for frostbite risk. I have a feeling that's for fingers and toes and other extremities, the arms are closer to the torso and \"meatier\" so they don't tend to get frostbite so fast. There are also amenities like heaters on the sidelines.\n\nLots of physical exertion can stave off frostbite at those temperatures. That's not an option for people in a survival scenario. But I guarantee you if one of these players complained they couldn't feel their arms it'd take less than a minute to get them inside and surrounded by medical professionals.","87":"Basically prolonged sitting, even with good posture, is detrimental to your health over a long period of time. It’s unnatural for the spine, neck, shoulders, to be in this position. There’s alot of science backing how bad long term sitting is for us which is a quick google\/youtube search away. \n\nI can’t say for sure how good prolonged static standing is, but I would bet money it’s better than sitting as it’s a NATURAL human posture. Meaning less pressure on your spinal discs and  more full body activation (when you sit you weaken your butt muscles and upper back muscles by literally turning them off). \n\nI bought a standing desk about 6 months ago. I study programming so I’ll be at the pc for multiple hours at a time. Now that I can stand I feel way better after a session at the computer. My back and neck pain have dramatically reduced. Downside: I have noticed a bit of leg and knee pain but it’s a simple as listening to your body and moving a bit to avoid it. Knee\/foot\/leg pain? Bend your knees a bit, shake up your legs and get the blood moving again. Don’t lock up your knees and keep the glutes active. \n\nThere may be negative effects to static standing, but prolonged sitting will literally take years off your life, give you forward head posture, and will cause muscle imbalances due to “turning off” specific muscles.","88":"They work differently. Caffeine blocks your brain’s andenosine receptors. Those receptors help your brain and body know you’re tired. When you block them with caffeine, you just feel more awake while the caffeine is working. \n\nCocaine however does a few things and they are entirely different from caffeine. Cocaine works with the dopamine transporters in your brain and clogs up the dopamine receptors. So you get a build up of dopamine in the synapse and it amplifies the effects of the dopamine. That’s why it’s so addictive- you’re getting like huge hits of dopamine (which is a natural brain chemical) but in a super unnatural way. \n\nSo while yes they are both stimulants- they work differently. Caffeine does interact with the dopamine brain chemicals and pathways, but not the way that cocaine does. \n\nThere are other dangers too with cocaine, like poor quality control, improper dosage (adderall is similar to cocaine but doses correctly for those who need it), method of delivery (often snorted or smoked versus a times release capsule like adderall), and impurities or additives to stretch the drug amount for sales, are just a few off the top of my head. Cocaine is also really awful for your heart. This also a risk with adderall usage, even when it’s prescribed and used appropriately. \n\n\nI hope this helps explain it!","89":"I've apparently missed the party -- but an HIV cure will almost certainly be feasible within the next decade.  \n\nHarnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-splicing system is completely changing the outlook for this type of sickness.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is an immune system for bacteria.  It identifies, very precisely, particular genes that (in its original use) are associated with particular viruses, and slices them out of any DNA inside the bacterium.  By splicing a particular \"key\" genome into the CRISPR system, it is possible to make it into a hyperspecific gene hunter\/killer that removes a particular gene (and replaces it with another) anywhere in your body.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to remove a genetic disease (sickle-cell anemia) from patients, using a custom-designed one-time serum that the doctors injected into the patient. It's a little more complicated than that, but CRISPR is the core of that method.\n\nRetroviruses, like HIV, are insidious because they splice themselves into your body's cells and become part of you.  With CRISPR-Cas9 serums, you could selectively splice the HIV back out. \n\nThat method will work for Herpes too, and also (eventually) all manner of other things that we think of as unchangeable right now.  Genetic diseases like hemophilia or *[Edit: disposition for]* type-1 diabetes; and also personal preferences, like what color your hair is or how much melanin is secreted into your skin.","90":"Imagine you're at a beach, playing with sand and rocks. The rocks don't move much, right? They just sit there. In the ocean, there are animals that are a bit like these rocks; they don't move much and might even look like rocks. These are animals like corals and barnacles. Why are they there in the ocean, but not on land? Well, it's because of how they live and what they need to survive.\n\nIn the ocean, water moves around a lot, bringing food to these \"rock\" animals. They can just stay in one place and grab food as it floats by. It's like if you could sit on your couch and have snacks come to you!\n\nBut on land, it's different. Animals need to move around to find their food because it doesn't just float to them. Imagine if you had to run around your house to catch your snacks – you couldn't just sit still!\n\nAlso, being a \"rock\" in the ocean helps these animals in other ways. It can protect them from being eaten and help them stay put in strong ocean currents. It's like having a super-strong house that keeps you safe and doesn't let you get washed away.\n\nSo, the ocean has \"sentient rocks\" because it's a place where you can stay still, get your food, and be safe, all at the same time. On land, things work differently, so animals need to move around to live and find food.","91":"No one is *intentionally* putting arsenic into cigarettes. But tobacco plants can absorb arsenic from the soil as they grow, much like rice, and the arsenic remains in the leaves as they are dried and ends up in the finished product. In its natural state it wouldn't be a problem, but you're consuming a relatively large amount of tobacco leaves since they've been dried and concentrated. \n\nTar is a confusing one, because the \"tar\" they are referring to is not the same as the \"tar\" you may be thinking of, its not the same stuff they put on roads and roofs. It's just a generic term for the sticky residue left by sooty tobacco smoke that results from incomplete combustion of the material. \n\nFormaldehyde is also not an intentional additive. But it's important to remember than burning is both a physical and a chemical reaction. The chemical we call formaldehyde just happens to be the resultant that forms when certain compounds burn. Lots of things create formaldehyde, it's also present in your cars exhaust. We just don't usually directly inhale it unless you're smoking tobacco. \n\nOutside of some things added to increase nicotine absorption and make them more addictive, there's not really anything intentionally added to cigarettes to make them more toxic. The people who invented them just didn't realize how bad it is for you to suck down unfiltered, particulate-laden smoke.","92":"Firstly, there is a green mammal.  The sloth.  They are generally covered with a layer of algae that does help them blend in.\n\nMinor trivia out of the way, the real reason is (probably because we don't know for sure yet) that mammals are all descended from small nocturnal stem mammals in the late Cretaceous.  Because they were nocturnal, vibrant colors generally weren't useful, and so didn't really get selected for.  Dark colors however, were.  As such, mammals use two types of melanin for pigmentation.  Both of these are brownish, reddish colors, and comprise the vast majority of all mammal pigmentation.  Using these two, you get yellows, browns, reds, and oranges, as well as black and white.  You will notice every single mammal only uses these colors, or shades and tints of these colors, in their coloration.  In some unique cases you do have blues, but this is not pigment but structural actually.  The structure of the surface traps non blue light and lets blue light out.  This is how baboons and blue eyes work.  Additionally ribrant reds are from blood circulation near the surface, this is also how baboons work.  You know the other half of them.\n\nSo the short answer is because we just don't have that pigment as an option as mammals.","93":"Most deaths are from Alzheimers patients not being able to take care of themselves and having accidents or untreated illnesses. A good nursing home can help this but without being able to get any help from the patient it becomes an impossible task to take care of them. A small infection for example which could be deadly for a senior citizen without medical attention might go unnoticed for days if the patient is not able to complain about pains. Even leaving a seriously ill Alzheimer patient unattended for a few minutes at night could cause you to miss them jumping on their bed falling over and braking bones, which for seniors could be fatal as their body does not heal the same way as adults.\n\nBut even with the best of care Alzheimers is still deadly on its own. The disease is destroying the nerve cells so the patients start losing neural function one by one. It does start with memory and coordination but eventually it spreads to more vital functions. When patients start losing control over their throat muscles controlling speech, swallowing and breathing they need constant attention and even then typically get associated complications such as acid reflux into their lungs and pneumonia. But even if they survive this the disease can spread to the nerves controlling their breathing causing them to just stop breathing.","94":"So pathogens have existed longer than we have. Bacteria, parasites, fungi, protozoans that are evolved to be a successful threat to humans. The thing is, humans are actually pretty hard to infect. We are covered in an ablative layer of keratine that is constantly growing and sluffing off. We have only a few openings in that later to the outside world, and they all have defenses to keep stuff out. This is necessary because the outside world would love to kill you. You are covered in bacteria that would readily devour you if it could only get inside. \n\nYour mouth has antiviral agents inside it. Your nose and ears are filled with ablative layers of wax that trap pathogens so they can't get inside. Your eyes are flushed with fluids. Your digestive system has acids and immune agents to keep stuff out. Etc...\n\nBasically for a pathogen to be successful, it needs to evolve a way to overcome your defenses effectively. Some viruses are airborne and very effective at attacking throat or lung tissue. These tend to be quite contagious. Some tend to use the mucous membranes or tiny cracks in the skin when these megafauna exchange DNA as part of a binding process necessary for reproduction. These pathogens are called STDs, but they could also be spread other ways. For something to get this label, it generally has to be so hard to catch that, if it didn't have sex as a vector, it wouldn't spread quickly enough to stay around. If it was easier to catch it would just be a disease.","95":"Any joint in the body is like a door hinge. Just like a door hinge there is a range of motion of a joint. It can go from fully opened to fully closed. Now imagine you don’t use the door for 20 years, it will be harder to open all the way it will struggle and creak. The same thing happens to our joints if you don’t use them through their full range of motion. \n\nNow it might seem surprising but we actually almost never use the hip joint through its full range of motion (that would be knees touching chest). The closest we get is sitting in chairs which is about half way through. \nDoing this for 50 years straight does to the joint the same thing it did to the door hinge - makes it harder to impossible to work through. This process then means hips are less stable, muscles are weaker and surrounding areas are also improperly trained\/used. This whole process is an ideal environment for an injury. \n\nPeople who do sports (not professionally) are much less likely to develop those problems because they are basically using their body the way it’s supposed to be used. Squatting all the way without chairs every day can also help. \n\nJust to add I’ve oversimplified the action of the hip joint a bit because it can actually move from side to side a little too but for this example that’s not important.","96":"It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain.   \n\n\nSome animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density.  \n\n\nLike crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got. Humans have larger brains than other primates, and a similar neuron density, so we've got a lot of neurons AND a lot of brains.  \n\n\nMinke whales have a brain that's 2.7 kg, compared to the humans average of 1.4 kg. But they only have 2\/3rds the amount of neurons in a human brain, indicating that their neural density is a bit lower than ours.   \n\n\nNow, is it the absolute number of neurons in the cerebrum that matters, or is it the density? Is it both? We don't completely know, but orcas have more neurons in their cerebrum overall than ours. In fact orcas have more neurons in their cerebrum than any mammal, maybe they're the smartest animals but just don't have hands to use tools with? But, they have lower neuronal density, so maybe their neurons have to do more work to achieve the same level of inter-connectedness our neurons have.  \n\n\nWe don't really know, we might not be the smartest species, but we are the most successful of the smart animals. The smartest kid in your high school class might not be the most successful though, so that tracks.","97":"I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. \n\nSo to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose. Notice how this system doesn't leave any room for simple excretion of the excess. \n\nTo add on to this, normal kidney function at normal blood glucose leads to complete retention of all glucose (it gets filtered out of the blood into the nephron and then reabsorbed down the line). You do end up with (Edit: ~~urine in the blood~~ oops) sugar in the urine if you have diabetes as the reuptake transporters get completely saturated. But this only happens because the normal balance between insulin and glucagon has been disrupted. We would also rather have normal insulin function than this because excess glucose can be very damaging, including things like kidney disease, eye disease, nerve disease, etc. High blood sugar will directly kill you so blocking the effects of insulin for the sake of stopping fat production is not an option.","98":"If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream.\n\nThere's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise.\n\nBut, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still (making you cold\/weak\/tired) - it might do both, but the homeostasis process is just trying to guard your energy stores. If the food is convincingly unavailable, burning fat to make you function will eventually happen (and the sensations will ease up) but it's not the first choice. Same, incidentally with cold - first try is to make you feel uncomfortable and ask you (that way) to put on a sweater - but if the sweater or warm refuge is unavailable, giving up and burning calories to make heat will eventually happen (and you might even feel warm and comfortable again at that point).\n\nThe precise dynamics have an element of context\/acclimatization to them, as well as inputs like hormonal gender - testosterone is a nudge towards guarding your fat stores less. Some people have a body composition set point above which mobilizing fat stores is far easier.","99":"Similarly, it bothers me when people require a purpose for a specific animal or species to exist.   \n\n\nWe can assign a benefit to the ecosystem. But it's usually arbitrary. Things just be. And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed.   \n\n\nIf you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier. But as humans we hate loss so we see a species that existed, being killed off as damaging.   \n\n\nTo take it even a step further, when people complain that humans are evil because they damage the environment. No, we change it. There is no objective, structural value to an environment that's being degraded. We decide what's desirable and that it *should* exist. And if humans didn't exist, there would be no one to decide what *should* be. Increased sea levels and temperature will kill current life. But the life that exists after will be able to withstand the change. Probably thriving in it and being weak to our present environment.   \n\n\nI'm not saying we don't stop climate change. Just that is isn't inherently evil. If we wipe ourselves out, we're just a thing that happened. Good or evil? Nah. Just incompetent. Like having sweaty palms while rock climbing.","100":"The Iron in our blood does get pulled! Actually the magnet is strong enough that the water in our bodies is pulled. I think the question is why doesn't it get pulled out of us? That is because the rest of our bodies are putting more force holding it in place. Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong. \n\nI know some people will say the Iron in your blood isn't magnetic, but the interesting thing is that MRIs make things magnetic because an MRI is two magnets. One makes everything in your body more like a magnet. The other is to change the way they sit so as the relax they give off radio waves. \n\nThe way I tell people to think about it is like a table full of tops, the main magnet just gets all the tops spinning. They spin at 42.58MHz per Tesla of the big magnet so very fast. Then the second magnet to the side of the table knocks them all over. Slowly they will spin around on the table, then go back to standing and spinning at the old speed. But as they are knocked over we are recording them notice 42.58MHz sounds like a radio station, that's why we capture radio waves. \n\nDifferent parts of your body are holding the little tops in place tighter or looser. I.e. the white matter goes back to normal faster than the grey and that is how you can see the contrast. \nNow this is usually done with hydrogen but you can actually tune an MRI to pick up the signal from iron I've seen the images from it. They are generally bad because there just isn't much of it in our bodies to make a strong signal.\n\nI skipped a fair bit but I'm trying to ELI5 the big take away is that all the same electro magnetic forces of your body holding it in place are much stronger because they are much closer.","101":"Your question stems from the fact that we, as humans, don’t always have an intuitive grasp of how much energy a process requires.\n\nHere’s an example: I have a 3000mAh lithium battery that can fly my drone for like 45 minutes. Let that sink in: it can fucking FLY. I can get it to rest on the roof of my nearby Costco, come back, tail my car, and do all of this for a decent amount of time. This same 3000mAh battery could also power a single one of my heated gloves to… make it a bit warm for 2 hours. Wow.\n\nCertain processes require more energy than their apparent effort would seemingly require. When you factor in the interplay between muscles and skeleton, your body is a very efficient machine for movement. And movement in general isn’t as energy intensive as one would assume. But heating — especially maintaining homeostasis — is.\n\nThink about it. Your body must — MUST, or you die — constantly stay around 37°, despite your environment typically being over 15 degrees cooler. This consumes an enormous amount of energy, energy that is effectively just radiated away off your skin and in your water vapour.\n\nTl;dr: your body works hardest of all keeping itself hot, which is very energy intensive.","102":"Birth control are synthetic *Progestins* AKA Progestogens that trick the body into thinking it's already pregnant. \n\nNormally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. \n\nProgestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it.  It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. \n\nProgestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant. \n\nThe point of this is essentially push pause on the normal ovulation cycle while the fetus is developing, so you don't end up with a second, concurrent fetus several months later. That would mean labor would not only certainly be fatal to the second fetus, but would present an additional risk to the mother, while using up blood supply and nutrients.\n\nThis doesn't generally effect an embryo that has already implanted. \n\nIndeed, levels of progesterone and other related natural progestins would begin to rise already after implantation, in response to the production of HCG by the embryo, which is the hormone that pregnancy tests detect. In that case increased progestins in the body are actually beneficial by improving the quality of them endometrial lining of the uterus.","103":"The same way when you eat lots of super salty food you will notice the next day your fingers are more swollen, it’s because salt makes your body hold on to fluids making it hard to take a ring off the next day. But if you drink lots of water the day after, you can flush out all that extra salt and now your fingers aren’t swollen and you can remove your rings easily again. Our bodies typically maintain an important balance between how much salt\/water circulates on its own, and literally flooding the system with either one will have side effects ranging from minor like swollen fingers to fatal. Your body, and especially your brain needs to maintain certain elements in a “normal” range so things work correctly just like a car engine needs oil or coolant. That “normal” range of sodium literally keeps your brain hydrated (and to a perfect level of puff let’s say so it can occupy your skull in exactly the way it needs to). If you drink 6L of water in a short period of time you dilute your body and your brains sodium concentration (which is responsible for helping our body hold on to water and keeping your brain tissue perfectly puffy,  hydrated and unable to exit its designated area), ultimately causing the lowest portion of your brain, (which is responsible for all of our automatic bodily functions like heart beat and breathing) tissue to overswell and slip out of its perfect position in your skull down into your upper spinal cord area. The dangerous part is that when your bodies sodium level normalizes again the part of your brain that slipped out of its previously spacious and forgiving skull into your upper neck\/spine it will can’t go back to its normal volume but in a MUCH more restrictive space, more or less strangling the brain, and not allowing it to send the signals to make your heart beat and your lungs breathe.","104":"You can. It's just not sensible to.\n\nOf the commonly abused substances likely to lead to dependence\/addiction, very few lead actual potentially fatal withdrawals: alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates. The last of the three has widely been superseded by benzos since it has a much worse safety profile without much benefits.\n\nAll the other substances likely to foster dependence -- and even those highly unlikely or virtually impossible to, such as the classical psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT) -- aren't going to kill you even if you quit cold turkey from however massive a habit. Sure, heroin withdrawals after a decade of daily IV use will make you wish you were dead so the pain would stop; but benzo withdrawals will actually just make you dead.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia of any kind is by design just an extremely risky thing. It doesn't take much at all to result in the patient never regaining consciousness. Sometimes they just never do anyway, even if nothing went wrong. It's trying to bring you as close to death as possible, and then trying to maintain that precarious balance for however long as is necessary, and then trying to make you come back alive. It's an exceedingly delicate thing, and plain irresponsible of a thing in terms of a medical procedure for an ailment so trivial and survivable without any medical intervention (except in a very small minority of cases).\n\nInterestingly, one drug that's utilised to \"reverse\" the dependence on benzos in some exotic treatment regime not dissimilar to what you're asking, is flumazenil. Flumazenil acts as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose, the same way naloxone is for opioids, or ethanol for methanol poisoning. It can potentially \"reset\" a benzodiazepine dependency when administered. But it can also just as often result in inducing a massive seizure leading to death when administered to an individual with a heavy benzo (or plain GABA-ergic) tolerance.","105":"There are multiple factors involved in this, but it comes down to neurotransmitter deficits, particularly your GABA system, and something called glutamate rebound. Searching for alcohol, gaba, and glutamate on YouTube will probably find a better video than I could explain. \n\nIn essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you’re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good. \n\nOver time, the problem is that the body stops producing that which it is having supplemented, so, if your neurotransmitters were already out of balance, then the alcohol makes it worse by giving your body another source of making this happen, so you just go deeper in the hole. \n\nIt’s very similar to how opioid abuse downregulates endorphins so your body stops producing its own. Endorphins literally means morphine produced inside - same principle - that which comes from external sources will eventually be outsourced entirely = no more natural happy chemicals. Alcohol is just extra destructive because it’s also hard on liver and kidneys which play a key role in balancing neurotransmitters in the first place. \n\nThis is why many people are turning to psilocybin (mushrooms), they can, in some cases, hack the internal system into producing more of the others because they mimic serotonin, BUT they carry high risks for paranoid disorders like schizophrenia and other disorders like bipolar can be exacerbated greatly. \n\nNeurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, gaba, etc. are an incredibly delicate balancing act.","106":"A baby’s head is too big for the hole it needs to come out of. This makes it harder for the baby to come out safely because it needs to be in exactly the right position - a bit like a (meaty) shape sorter. Otherwise, the baby can get stuck, and that can lead to extreme tiredness and stress (the mother’s body working too hard), which can kill both the mother and the baby, or bleeding, which can also kill the mother or the baby. \n\nEven if the baby does manage to come out exactly right, there’s a second bit called the placenta which also has to be born. It’s like a big, slippery, veiny frisbee that attaches to the baby’s belly button and feeds the baby while it’s in its mother’s tummy. Sometimes, the placenta doesn’t come out properly - a bit of it can get left behind. This can lead to bleeding - which can kill the mother - or to infection, which can also kill the mother. Infection is when germs get into your body and make you ill. If an infection gets REALLY bad, you can die. \n\nTalking of infection: the womb (the space in a woman’s body where a baby grows) is like a big, open wound just after a baby’s born - so there’s a lot of space for germs to grow in and make the mother very ill. Again, if she gets ill enough, she can die. \n\nThat’s how I would explain the basics to a five year old. Not even going into things like pre-eclampsia or amniotic fluid emboli or any of the other less common but still eminently deadly conditions that can appear peri-natally.","107":"It’s because we are always fertile, instead of coming into heat a few times a year. Humans didn’t evolve to have a litter or two a year and raise their young to be fully independent in a few months. We evolved to  have just a few babies over our whole life. Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. \n\nThis is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains. They need to be born kind of underdeveloped for survival because otherwise their heads would be so big that it would be too dangerous for the mother to give birth to them. Because babies are born not fully developed, instead of having lots of instincts already set up in their brains, they have to be taught how to do almost everything. Almost all human behavior is stuff that we learn from our families, our friends, and the people around us. That means that human behavior can change really rapidly in response to new situations. Because almost all behavior is learned, it means that it can also be replaced with new information later in life if the situation calls for it. One of the reasons humans have been so successful is that we can learn, adapt, and change to tolerate almost any situation, environment, or set of resources. Humans live in every climate, eat every kind of food (and even can figure out how to turn poisonous foods into delicious foods), and have all sorts of different systems of behaving. We are incredibly adaptable thanks to giving birth to half-baked babies with giant heads.\n\nBecause humans can have children at any point in their reproductive life, that means that you can have a baby every few years and devote a lot of time and energy to just that one child’s needs and education. The trade off, though, is that since your body doesn’t know when you are going to get pregnant, your body is constantly preparing for a possible pregnancy. As a result, a monthly period during your reproductive cycle. It’s something we got from our primate ancestors, and it’s common in other primate species including apes, and old and new world monkeys. These primate species also have relatively undeveloped babies that they devote a lot of time and effort on, and they also have adaptable behavior that depends a lot on social learning.\n\nOne cool thing is why our periods stop. Instead of being capable of reproducing until we die, menopause creates a whole class of grandparents who were essential for helping to care for those really dependent infants and toddlers, for their own grown kids, and for the community at large. Elder community members played essential roles in human evolution by helping to support their families and communities even after their reproductive life was over.","108":"As a person ages the body naturally slows down. This includes all parts of the body. Whereas a younger person’s kidneys and liver works in a 16 hr period older people’s kidneys and livers work 24\/7 which cause people to get up at night to go to the bathroom as an example. The skin is another way for the body to get rid of toxicity in the body just like the liver and kidneys do. When their efforts are not sufficient even in a 24 hr day then smelly toxic products will be sweated out through the skin throughout the 24 hr day no matter what a person does regarding activity. This drastically changes a person’s personal body odor to that of a stinky old person odor. Often older people will say they have not done anything so they don’t need to bath or shower. Yet they do for this very reason. It is no longer just the armpits, now they release smells all over and need to be washed off, even with a washcloth and cleanser often. Medications can also make a person’s odor change as well as a poor diet can add to this problem, all of which are common as people age. Some younger people also have bad body odor due to poor diet and medications too. Some people have no idea what their own bodies even smell like because our own brains block out negative odors of our own bodies. Just a point to consider so be aware when discussing this with anyone.","109":"Dolphins - like humans - are highly social and communicative animals. Communication and social activity comes naturally to both of us.\n\nThis isn't true of most animals a dolphin is likely to encounter. Most sea animals - fish, cephalopods (like octopus and squid) and sharks aren't social at all, and most aren't intelligent. They have either no interest or no capacity to interact with anyone - in the case of fish, dolphins likely just see them as food, in the same way most of us view a chicken.\n\nThe only other intelligent, social animals a dolphin is likely to ever meet is other ceteceans (whales and dolphins) and humans.\n\nWhales are social, intelligent animals, but aren't quite as smart as humans or dolphins. I wouldn't be surprised if dolphins had tried to communicate with whales and sort-of succeeded - there are a handful of accounts of dolphins helping beached whales, or dolphins and whales forming mixed social groups and co-operative hunting pods.\n\nThere's another factor too - humans are weird. When we encounter dolphins in the wild, we are essentially like aliens to them. We aren't aquatic, we can't swim very well, and we don't look like anything else in the sea. Dolphins are naturally curious, and often inspect us in their desire to learn.","110":"An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales).\n\nGenerally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. \n\nWomen's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a shorter gait and wider hips. This contributes to more efficient walking, standing, and less wear and effort expended on joints and muscles in the legs. Women's feet are more efficient under low stress. \n\nMen's feet are generally straighter, blocker, longer, and more heavily filled with thicker tendons and bones. They're designed to withstand high stress under sudden and short demands for high performance. This makes them inferior when walking long distances at a comfortable pace, but makes them highly desirable in a fight or flight scenario where an early small advantage can easily snowball into a massive overpowering victory.\n\nThis pattern is generally true of most difference in male\/female anatomy. The female body tends to focus on being highly efficient and maintaining adequate performance over long periods of moderate stress. The male body tends to be designed to achieve peak performance under extreme stress for short bursts, a trait which contributes massive advantages in combat and hunting, at the cost of being fairly inefficient in less demanding scenarios, and increasing the probability of injury.\n\nThe male body is effectively overengineered. It's designed to achieve immediate performance at all costs, usually meaning it can withstand exceptional abuse and perform incredible feats without degradation, up to the point of failure, but once failure is reached it tends to be catastrophic. The female body is appropriately engineered. It makes reasonable compromises in performance and cost, and is able to continue to maintain at least some performance longer over greater stress, but at the cost of having that gentler downward grade start earlier.","111":"Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes your tissues to start absorbing too much salt from your blood which is toxic. This means your kidneys need to kick into overdrive and filter out the salty blood as quickly as possible by just dumping out large amounts of water carrying the salt away. This process is also very damaging to your kidneys. IV fluids, on the other hand, are designed to have almost the exact same saltiness as your blood naturally has. This means your body doesn't need to spend any extra energy\/water trying to balance out the salt levels to maintain homeostasis (and doesn't experience toxic effects), and as such, it can much more easily use the IV fluids to hydrate itself.","112":"Your also trying to expell the keytones, the acids that are produced when you burn fat instead of carbs for energy, as insulin is what allows you to use carbohydrates for energy. Carbs are what diabetics count, not actual sugar. That's why sugar free candy will raise your blood sugar, because they have carbs. Often like 2\/3 the amount of carbs of normal sugar candy so those candies arent safe either. They keytones are what kills us when we neglect our blood sugar, they turn our blood acid and shut down our kidneys. When we are hyperglycemic we burn exclusively fat and produce way more keytones than our bodies can handle, leading to diabetic keto acidosis. This is what I was in in the above example. Dka can be lethal. I'm guessing it's the acidic content that causes the bladder pain but it might be some reaction of your body telling you that it really needs to get rid of these toxic chemicals, I'm not sure. What your talking about isnt DKA like I was addressing, DKA is an immediate concern and is a symptom of your blood literally turning acidic. It happens when your blood sugar is much higher than normal (like 250+) for an extended amount of time (a few days) It can kill you in a very short amount of time. When I lost my insurance at 26 I lasted 11 days and that's rationing with short acting Insulin but not long acting, back in the days of finger sticks before CGMs (these are amazing, you need one). 11 days is like Hanukkah type shit, I was the worst case the hospitals do tora had ever heard of. Most people will not last anywhere near that length of time. Forgot who my wife and child were and slipped into a coma, can barely see now because of it. Don't neglect your health.","113":"\"Because the process of vomiting is really hard on your body, and the *cessation* of vomiting is very much a relief by comparison. Emesis is a whole-body affair; your entire nervous system and essentially all your muscles are involved, and very little of your body remains under conscious control during the process. You hyperventilate (to keep from aspirating your stomach contents), your heart rate and blood pressure spike, the skeletal muscles in your extremities lock up, your diaphragm plunges deep into your abdomen, and the muscles of your trunk contract *hard* to increase the pressure on your stomach and … you know. Move things along.\n\nWhen that *stops,* along comes the burst of endorphins that accompanies any strenuous physical exertion. The sensation is not unlike a \"runner's high.\" Your blood pressure falls, your heart rate returns to normal, your blood is saturated with oxygen and you experience a short-lived state of mild euphoria due to increased concentrations of special bio-molecules called, unsurprisingly, endogenous euphoriants.\n\nNot to be overlooked, too, is the cessation of nausea. Nausea is a lot more *physiological* than many people realize. It's not just all in your head. The sensation is primarily caused by changes in your small intestine. Under normal circumstances, your small intestine is undergoing a process called *peristalsis.* Small, rhythmic muscle contractions — yes, your intestine is muscular; you won't be lifting any weights with it but it's basically a little muscle — move the contents of your intestine steadily \"downstream,\" as it were. When something goes wrong with your digestive system (or something *else* happens to your body that makes it *react* like there's something wrong with your digestive system) this regular motility slows or stops, and your whole intestine tenses up. It's this decreased motility and increased tone that serves as the underlying root cause of gastric nausea.\n\nWhen you vomit, that nausea goes away almost immediately. And that's a tremendous sense of relief. Just the cessation of gastric nausea itself is enough to make you feel much better after you've … you know. Done your business.\"\n\nOld answer from prior question in another subreddit.","114":"For starters, race and ethnicity are social constructs. They are arbitrary lines drawn around perceived differences that have been reinforced via social structures. There is little to no genetic, physiological, or physical differentiation between different ethnicities or races that does not partially rely also on social classifications. Even if we were to use melanin levels as a metric, easy classification of humans into distinct racial groups would be highly difficult and likely not align with our idea of \"race\".\n\nSecond, the physiological differences between your average member of one racial group versus another in almost everything but skin tone is so negligible as to be irrelevant, and certainly impossible to serve as a reliable means of identification from internal organs alone.\n\nThe belief that the race of an individual can be determined through physiological clues is called **scientific racism**, **racialism**, or **race realism**.\n\nThere are some *regional* variations in human ability that sometimes happen to correspond to our conceptions of \"race\" but they are coincidental side effects of natural selection in extreme circumstances and would likely happen to any population living in those areas (with the marginally higher lung capacities of Nepalese people being an example).","115":"In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._\n\nOtoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. \n\nWhen a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the brain. This is how all vertebrates know what's up and what's down.\n\nWe also detect movement this way, when they accelerate, the otoliths move, so they know which way they move to. The inner ear is the mechanism how vertebrates orient themselves on a vertical and horizontal axis. \n\nAs for why, there's a lot in the water that is still up and down. The floor is still down and the surface is still up. A lot of fish live in a specific layer of water and in order to stay there they use the otoliths to sense their movement. This requires them to be upright.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nEDIT: Using my own post to talk about the use and evolution of the swim bladder. The primary function of the swim bladder is buoyancy, though it also helps in stabilizing. In some fish it functions as a resonating chamber to produce or receive sound. (you read that right! Fish use sounds to communicate!!) \n\nMany bony fish have swim bladders, but none of the cartilaginous fish (rays and sharks) have them, indicating that the swim bladder evolved after the bony fish did, (420 😉 million years ago). The sharks and rays compensated by either staying on the sea floor, having stiff side fins (like a plane) or by storing fats and oils that are less dense than water, giving them buoyancy! \n\nHere's the best part... in some bony fish, the swim bladder evolved to allow the fish to extract oxygen from it, allowing them to survive in muddy riverbeds where the water had too low oxygen for gill respiration. It would just gulp air and then use that to \"breathe\", turning the swim bladder into a primitive lung. These fish, called lungfish, are the ancestors of all land-dwelling vertebrates. \n\nYeah, you have a swim bladder too, we just call them lungs!","116":"Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. \n\nStrength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy\/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to take place. \n\nDOMS are not indicative of \"a good workout\" like is commonly perceived. A new program taxing your musculature in a different way than previously experienced will invite inflammation, especially if said musculature is weak and focused during the early training days.  Think glute muscles in today's society where we spend so much time in a stretched and weakened glute state, so when these muscles are focused directly in a program you'll have more \"soreness\" early on as this tissue isn't used to being used purposefully. Compare this to a bicep workout, a muscle we use pretty regularly and purposefully in normal activities of daily living, and you'll have less DOMS as a principle after the workout. \n\nMost DOMS don't set it until 24-72 hours later though. As a strength coach, I don't think I've ever had myself or any clients report DOMS within the same day of a training impetus. You'll have varying degrees of *weakness* for the musculature for the following 10-12 hours after a lift, but this is just due to the tissue being exhausted during training. \n\nI think I answered the query?

They go from ramen and sparse finances justifying fewer meals to having more money and eating more in a sitting because their control was dictated by their wallet and not their constitution and habits. \n\nI also think elderly people tend to be at a point where they made the mistake and slimmed back down. Also more free time usually means more physical activity. \n\nI don't think its physical as much as a matter of societal factors...not to mention sample bias as you'd only see fit elderly people out. If they weren't they are probably in a home being cared for slowly dieing.\n\n\nAlso fat people are more likely to die early due to complications so could also be survivorship bias. The older people are the ones that were never fat.\n\n\nI would say there is an element of age in that you drink less as you get older and a LOT of overweight middle aged people are just alcoholics who drink too much beer and have poor impulse control.\n\n\nIdk too many factors to say any one is a culprit.

If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass.\n\nA great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy. A mutation that makes use lose the ability to make vitamin C means we no longer waste that energy. If starvation is more likely to kill us than the lack of vitamin C, shedding that ability is advantageous. Other animals without thumbs were probably not able to obtain vitamin C the same way we can, and as a result would not benefit from losing their ability to make vitamin C.\n\nOur ability to eat many things is likely the reason why we evolved to stop spending energy to make so many things. If you look at a dog, you may be surprised to learn how many things will poison them. Chocolate, onions, etc.\n\nTLDR, humans requiring many food types is an advantage, not a disadvantage, because those things are abundant and it does not make sense to waste energy making what is easily available to us.","119":"To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, compared to other developed countries, has a substantially higher infant mortality rate. This is a meta study, so looked accross methodologies of many different studies, and while the exact number (obviously) varied, the result was the same - looking at IMR, we are on par with Croatia, not the UK, Canada or Australia. \n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4856058\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4856058\/)\n\nDespite a pretty complete analysis, this data didn't really get at a single cause. For instance, income disparity only accounts for 30% fo the gap in infant mortality compared to Finland. So, while that is a chunk of the explanation (we have great healthcare, but only if you are that has it AND can afford it). To be fair - I think this may have been obfuscated by some low income jobs having better insurance. \n\nOne thing this paper didn't touch on was racial disparity in mortality rates. Black mothers are much more likely to die, and so are their children. Nearly double when compared to white families. \n\n[https:\/\/www.kff.org\/racial-equity-and-health-policy\/issue-brief\/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-current-status-and-efforts-to-address-them\/](https:\/\/www.kff.org\/racial-equity-and-health-policy\/issue-brief\/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-current-status-and-efforts-to-address-them\/)\n\nWhy? Economics (as outlined above) account for part of it. However, you can find testimony from black doctors who know they weren't getting the best treatment from otherwise great facilities. So, racism in the healthcare system is absolutely part of the problem. There is plenty of research out there that, in the US, black people are viewed as being more aggressive even while engaging in the same actions as white people - even when the subjects are toddlers. Combative patients generally get worse treatment.","120":">It's full of histamines, which triggers massive inflammation. This starts temporarily, but eventually causes permanent damage to the capillaries in the face, causing that rosey red look of a heavy drinker.\n\nI am an Allergist. This is garbage. Histamine only causes inflammation in the bloodstream and tissue, not GI tract. Histamine is destroyed by acid and pepsinogen in the stomach and diamine oxidase in the intestines long before it can cross over. Histamine release from mast cells already resident in the body can happen. Still, histamine in your food has no effect whatsoever on histamine levels in the bloodstream, unless you have an enzyme deficiency and even then the evidence is pretty inconclusive.

PMID: 21165702.","121":"The notion of \"apex\" predator\" is flawed in a lot of scenarios regarding animals. Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently.\n\nIn such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators. This rarely happens because rarely there is an animal that is able to localize and identify such vulnerable individuals to exploit and do opportunistic predation, as well as the risk of injuries.\n\nWhen an animal have higher sociality and engages in more complex cooperative hunting, the ability to handle the stress of large meals is unneeded because the pack with a high success rate for hunts can simply hunt again. And likely to be deleterious to the species, as the animals in the pack would fight with each other much more frequently if they had such ability, as well as the fact that cooperative hunters are frequently individually smaller than prey.\n\nSo it is a trait that it is likely to have been negative selected in hominids but also likely to have been negative selected in animals such as wolves and dogs.","122":"Your body can generate energy to fuel your muscles in different ways.\n\nAt low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen.\n\nWhen you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again.\n\nThis happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust.\n\nOnce you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it.\n\nTo generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy.\n\nThis chemical that glycogen combines with is called lactate and it's the reason why your muscles start to burn when you start working out with a lot of intensity.\n\nOnce you adjust to higher intensities, your body produces less lactate (it's a byproduct of generating energy without oxygen) and your muscles can work at a higher intensity without \"burning\". \n\nThe \"burning\" sensation is actually the lactate breaking apart and releasing a hydrogen ion. \n\nWhen you stop working out, it takes some time to get rid of the hydrogen ions that are still left in your muscles. The time needed to do this is called the \"recovery time\".\n\nThis is why you can still have heavy legs if you're sprinting 10 x 400m.

In other words she didn't start creating an over abundance of new fat cells till then. Unfortunately this new fat cell creation was post menopause and thus her body distributed it more like a male with most of it going on the belly viscerally. Not yet understanding why she had a more male distribution, but I recognised the danger about 5 years ago when a random YT video appeared in my feed about an autopsy of a 70yo woman from Heart disease and a heart attack. The woman on the slab was the exact shape my mother had become. Scared the life out of me and for the last 5 years I'd been trying to persuade Mum to lose the weight. Unfortunately mum kept putting off the weightloss and it ended up costing her her life probably 20 years before her time.\n\nThe corrollory is some of her Sisters\/my aunts 2 years younger and Older. They were technically obese at times pre menopause in their 20's-40's and lost a good bit of the weight post menopause. However, even if they regained again post menopause, they would still deposit most of it more safely on their ass and thighs because their body had already created an over abundance of fat cells in those locations in their younger days pre-menopause. The body only creates new fat cells when the already existing ones are full up. So my aunts actually have a safe fat cell buffer so to speak created when they were younger women to absorb weight gain even now post menopause. Mum being thin all her life pre-menopause had no such ass and thigh fat cell buffer and didn't start needing to create new fat cells till after the menopause whereupon all the new fat cells were created viscerally and abdominally like a man.","124":"Paramedic. \n\nNo, that is not what you need to do. \n\nProjectile, be it bullet, arrow or other, either needs to stay in, or out. Are you within hours to a day or so from definitive care (surgery, hospital)? Projective stays in. The body will have already started to form clots around it, you don’t want to disrupt them. Are you day or more from definitive care? Balance between haemorrhage and infection swings. Time to get the projectile out - it carried microorganisms from the clothing and skin into the body. Yes, they’re already in there, but removing the item decreases the infective load. \n\nOkay, so we’ve dealt with what to do with the projectile. \n\nNow, the bleeding. The projectile will have caused local tissue damage, disrupting blood vessels and causing localised bleeding. You will also have lost some tissue compression - you’ve disrupted the tissue, and with some projectiles, removed tissue. This means where there used to be something applying pressure, there is now nothing. Disrupted vessels + no local pressure = lots of blood. \n\nYou need to pack the wound, preferably with sterile stuff.

You want to jam as much into the wound as you can, to replace the lost tissue effect, to apply pressure *directly* to the walls of the wound channel. \n\nWound packing complete, you want external pressure.

This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure.  At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi).  A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death.  To mitigate this as a diver we do our best to ascend no faster than 1 meter per 3.3 seconds (1 foot per second) and perform a safety stop at 5 meters (approx. 15 feet) for at least 3 minutes.  We also avoid flying for at least 24 hours after a dive has ended as flying can still cause decompression illness.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other version we also refer to as and treats the same is lung over expansion.  This tends to happen when someone panic's and holds their breath during ascension often along with a rapid ascent.  Basically your lungs are similar to a balloon and start to burst.  This happens because as in above when the external pressure increases the amount of air in our lungs also increases.  It's referred to as Boyle's law.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor both we treat with oxygen in as high of a concentration as available (most boats carry emergency O2 but even using something like EAN32 (Enriched Air Nitrox 32% oxygen) will help.

Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.\n\nWhen you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).\n\nNow, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.\n\nLet's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.\n\nThe Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.\n\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nTL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another.

Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with.  A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during.\n\nSpiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses.  Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward\/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA.  This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first.  That's not to say spiders can't learn, or that they are all the same.  Spiders can learn and have their own personalities.  Particularly active hunters, like jumping spiders, or social spiders.\n\nGenerally speaking spiders eat webs that don't catch flies and relocate.  They will periodically eat and rebuild nets that do work as well, to keep them effective.  A decent component of a spider's diet can be the pollen and plant matter that catches in their old webs and gets eaten along with the silk.

Yes humans intervene and fix that and clear the infection\n The answer would be in the wild they would live with something stuck in their foot and it being infected for either until it heals themself, for the rest of their lives they need to live with the pain or it gets so bad that they cannot walk\/stand anymore and then they just die or get eaten (and thus die)\n\nI saw a similar thought process multiple times wenn it comes to modern vs old humans. \n\n\" Back then they didn't have healthcare and toothbrushes so how were they fine without it but we need this\"\n\nThe answer is they were not fine. They lost their teeth like crazy and either they barely had any teeth left in their mouth or they died to rotting teeth getting infections, etc.\nAlso the life expectancy of ancient humans were barely over 20years old and that is a lot less time for stuff to fuck up your teeth than modern humans living 80+ years. So there is much more of a need now to keep your teeth health's for that long compared to only 20years","133":"# ELI5:\nWomen's bodies are like a one room hotel. \n\nWhen no one is staying they have monthly cleanings, but for the most part anyone can come in and stay.\n\nOnce someone rents the room though, they just turn on the NO VACANCIES sign and no one can come in.\n\nThis is how women's birth control works. It fakes turning on the NO VACANCIES sign, which is easy because it is already built into the building.\n\nMen's bodies more are like a touristy country. They produce hundreds of thousands of guests that want to visit this motel very badly. \n\nHowever you can't just shut down the boarders. You'd have to build (or destroy) a lot of stuff. At the motel the sign to prevent vacancies is built in. For men's bodies we'd have to build something new. And well we've pretty much never done that. In fact some people think it is even unethical to build things at all, messing with the natural growth of the country. Heck even many of the things we have tried to build haven't stopped these people - they are resourceful. They will climb walls, fly over them, take boats. \n\nSure if you really want to, you can go overboard and destroying all of the planes and airports and make it deadly to try to cross the ocean by drying up all the water...but what if you want to re-open the boarders again? Its really hard to undo damage like that.\n\n# ELI13:\n\nWomen's bodies already have signals to turn off reproductive cycle. We just need to fake the signal with hormones. Men's body's don't ever naturally stop the reproductive cycle. So we have to BUILD in something that stops it...except it has to be semi-permeant and 100% reversible. \n\nThat's the really hard part. Things like vasectomy's are easy, and we can undo them...but they're dangerous and are often irreversible. Surgery is dangerous as well even for something as simple as a vasectomy. And since we don't have any existing mechanisms to turn it off, most of our attempts are like dams inside the penis that are flexible, permanent, non-toxic, and can easily be dissolved with a non-toxic chemical...that's tough. \n\nTrying to add a hormone to stop male reproductive cycle would quite literally be like adding a new OS version to the male operating system. But we don't even have anyone that can write operating system code, and even if we do - what are the dangers of doing such a thing?","134":"As long as the roots have oxygen, they will survive. This is how roots can grow in water, because the water is in contact with the air to exchange oxygen. The issue is when the soil is made of of things that can rot. Most \"potting soil\" that is sold at the store is ground up trees, which will rot when continuously wet. When the wood chips in the \"potting soil\" rot, they use all the oxygen, and the roots around it die. If there is nothing in the soil that can rot, then there is no such thing as overwatering. If your plants live in a well drained sand\/silt\/clay mixture, you can water as much as you want and the plant will never ever rot. Water has oxygen in it when it rains or we water, so there has to be something in the soil to use up that oxygen to kill the roots. Growing a plant hydroponically (roots in pure water) is the fastest way to grow a plant because the roots have unlimited water and oxygen. The most lush place on Earth is the rainforest, where it rains everyday, and the soil never dries out, yet the plants seem to do OK there (because the roots are in soil made of minerals that don't rot, and the leaf litter, mulch, compost etc is all sitting on top of the soil where it can rot into compost with access to oxygen). This whole \"wait until your plant is dry before you water it or you'll kill\" thing is only because they sell potting soil that is full of things ready to rot if they stay wet too long. If your soil is made of minerals (dirt) and therefore can't rot, there is no such thing as overwatering and you'll have happy plants.\r  \n\r  \nHere are a couple videos that explain this:\r  \n\r  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KHZHy3\\_7PPE&t=2s\r  \n\r  \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MuFehTDAIAE","135":"Well, it depends on the pathogen in question.\n\nMost viral particles quickly become non-viable on a dry non-porous surface with no host.\n\nA lot of pathogenic bacteria will, too.\n\nBut some can survive in the environment without a host, or can ensporulate (basically dry up and form an impermeable coating that preserves dormant genes and cell machinery).\n\n* One particularly nasty example of spore-forming bacteria would be [C. botulinum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clostridium_botulinum), the bacterium responsible for botulism.\n* Botulinum toxin is ounce-for-ounce one of the deadliest biological agents we know of.\n* C. botulinum is a common soil bacterium that gets on random surfaces all the time. It *typically* only produces toxin when it's active and reproducing\/living in an anaerobic environment (like a jar of honey, or a jar of green beans that didn't get hot enough to kill the spores during canning and doesn't have enough salt or acid to inhibit bacterial reproduction).\n* Another spore-former would be the dreaded [C. difficile](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clostridioides_difficile), which can cause some very nasty diahhreal illness, especially in guts that lack well-developed flora of their own - like a young infant's - or where broad-spectrum antibiotics have weakened the existing gut biome.\n\nDiahrreal illness is a leading cause of infant mortality. It's worse in countries with poorly-developed sanitation (where contaminated water might be used for formula) and poor access to healthcare, but industrial countries aren't immune. It's probably best not to risk contaminating breast milk by opening them with an unwashed implement.\n\nThe point is, you're not going to sterilize it in soap and water, either, but your odds of NOT introducing a pathogen to your baby's relatively naive system are much better if you give soap and water a shot at dissolving debris and washing those spores down the drain before you use the scissors on the bag.","136":"It’s actually because of 2 reasons. They are also kind of interlinked. \n\n- firstly babies have very large heads (relatively) and they have a straight spine (that gets bent in and out as we age - which is normal). Having a large and heavy head and a weak neck will make it very hard to hold the head anywhere other than straight over the rest of the body. You can try wearing a heavy helmet and you’ll see that slouching to look at your phone becomes extremely difficult. \n\n- this brings us to the second reason. That is modern society habits. Looking at phones, or writing in schools. We spend a lot of times doing things where we are slouched forward after about age 6,7. This is not natural and this can cause you to just get used to this slouched position. Some muscles become stronger, some weaker and as a result your body adapts to this ‘wrong’ position. Which then feels very unnatural to correct. This is made even worse by the fact that a young body develops around the environment it’s in and sometimes spending your childhood slouched can lead to such changes that will never be naturally corrected. \n\nSo how do we change that? It’s very simple actually. Do the thing that makes it worse - less. Sit on the phone less. Walk with your head up more. Some specific exercises can help too those can easily be looked up. \n\nBut the advice I’ll always give to any parent is make sure your child does some sort of physical activity. I’m not talking about making them squat 3x their body weight, but do some sort of consistent physical challenge. Be it football, or swimming or running or whatever. From the age of about 7-8 to 18 is the age at which you are making use of the growth hormone. This is basically the age during which your body builds bones and connective tissues that will then be used for the rest of your life. \n\nNot only that but also during a young age people can learn proper(or bad) body patterns (like good posture) that will almost never be broken later even if they stop doing any sports and spend 20 years sitting over the desk. This is why paying attention to this during a young age is extremely important.\n\nI forgot to add that in poorer societies that don’t have modern habits like sitting in cars or over the desk, all of the adults have postures just as perfect as any child.","137":"Long distance running problems\/risks (and the things you describe) in no particular order:\n1. The white is likely dried salt from your sweat.\n2. Nipples are raw from chafing due to your shirt and the constant friction for hours. This can also occur in the thighs\/butt.\n3. Muscle cramps from a combination of muscle microtears and low electrolytes (sodium and potassium mainly)\n4. Low electrolytes from sweating (loss of sodium) and urine concentration (your kidneys want to hold onto water but still get rid of waste, long story short your urine becomes concentrated, which why it’ll be more dark yellow, and you’ll lose potassium to hold onto the sodium you’re already low on), further compounded by the water you drink during the run (no electrolytes in it to replace, what you have becomes more dilute). At its worst this can cause seizures\/heart rhythm problems.\n5. Stress fractures in long bones, especially the tibia (shin bone)\n6. Joint stress\/overuse injury\n7. Heat exhaustion\/hypothermia depending on the environment\/exertion\n8. Kidney injury from a combination of dehydration and the risky of rhabdomyolysis, a condition where severe muscle strain causes proteins to leak from the muscles into the blood which then punch literal microscopic holes in the kidneys - tea\/cola\/brown colored urine is characteristic of this.\n9. Diarrhea - severe stress causes blood to be shunted away from the GI system and to the heart\/brain\/muscles preferentially resulting in a low-flow state in the intestines. Over a couple hours this makes the intestines irritable, causing pain, cramps, and “the trots”. This also makes electrolyte imbalance worse.\n10. Blackened\/loss of toenails from repeated small trauma of the toes against the front of the shoes.\n\nThere’s probably more, but these are the things that I’ve treated long distance runners for in the past. Running is wonderful, including long distance, but you have to be smart about it and that starts with knowing the risks. Protect your skin, stay hydrated but also supplement with an electrolyte beverage during the run, dress appropriately and in layers, wear the right size shoes, train appropriately beforehand to build strength\/tolerance, and try not to run on a full stomach. I don’t personally recommend running with caffeinated supplements because it can mask your body telling you “this is painful and bad and you should stop” by turning down the fatigue stimulus, but plenty of people do it safely.","138":"\"Air time\" has a strange effect on your body because your body is not completely solid — it is composed of many parts. When your body is accelerated, each part of your body accelerates individually. The seat pushes on your back, the muscles in your back push on some of your organs and those organs push on other organs. That's why you feel the ride with your entire body. Everything inside is being pushed around.\n\nNormally, all the parts of your body are pushing on each other because of the constant force of gravity. But in the \"free-fall\" state of plummeting down a hill, there is hardly any net force acting on you. In this case, the various pieces of your body are not pushing on each other as much. They are all, essentially, weightless, each falling individually inside your body. This is what gives you that unique sinking feeling in your stomach; your stomach is suddenly very light because there is less force pushing on it. The same thing happens when you drive down a dip in the road in your car or descend in an elevator moving at high speed.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/science.howstuffworks.com\/engineering\/structural\/roller-coaster6.htm)\n\n\nEdit:  \nSince a lot of people have asked how this works for astronauts, u\/mces97 provided this info in one of the comments:\n\nTo add on to this, when you're in space, like on the space station, that feeling is constant. At least according to an Astronaut I spoke with at a meet and greet before a shuttle launch. He said many astronauts puke when they first experience \nweightlessness.","139":"You know why? I’ll tell ya why. June the 29th, 1945. We'd just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb.\n\nDidn't see the first shark for about a half-hour. 13-footer. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail.\n\nWhat we didn't know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.\n\nSometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... 'til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces. You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour.\n\nThursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again.","140":"This is a age old question and there are several possible answers, most of which has already been given here. In summary:\n\n* 1). Geology. Lake is or has been connected to other bodies of water, possibly underground like the limestone\/karst mentioned at length elsewhere.\n\n* 2). Topology. Meandering rivers changing course, leaving ox-bow lakes.\n\n* 3). Weather. Floods covering lowlands, reaching lakes and receding again. (Or the very rare, but real, \"rain of fish\"!)\n\n* 4). Humans. Deliberate or accidental stocking of lake.\n\n* 5). Birds. Ever popular, but very badly researched area (at least a few years ago, when I tried to review the topic). A few different scenarios:\n\n* 5a). Bird transporting weeds\/branches with eggs on them (e.g. for  nesting material). Quite plausible, fertilized fish eggs of many species are very resilient.\n\n* 5b). Fertilized eggs adhering to birds' feet or feathers. Plausible IMO, but not proven AFAIK. The only study I found dismissed the idea, but did so from not finding any eggs on the feathers of birds taken by hunters. It didn't seem to occur to them, that hunting season and fish breeding season is not overlapping in Northern Europe!\n\n* 5c). Birds eating fish eggs and defecating viable ones. This was shown with ducks and both crucian carp and goldfish eggs a few years back.\n\n* 5d). Bird of prey dropping a live fish away from where it was caught. Happens all the time, but for it to produce a population of fish, it would take either: Happening twice (with a male and a female fish (preferably of the same species, see below)). Happening with a fertilized live-bearing species. Happening with a female of a species capable of [Parthenogenesis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parthenogenesis) (\"virgin birth\") or happening with a female of a species capable of [Gynogenesis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gynogenesis) (\"sperm parasitism\") and a male of another species.

If that’s covered you can last for several weeks without trouble, as long as you weigh enough.\n\nThis time really cannot be extended much by solely consuming oil, because it‘s the lack of vitamins and minerals that is actually causing you to die.\n\n\nOur bodies of healthy, and of average weight store quite a large amount of fat that would already be used if you are starving. Doesn‘t really matter whether you fat storage gets used or the oil you drink.\n\nBut there‘s vitamins that we only have stores for a couple of weeks, same with minerals. You are constantly losing salt through sweat and urine.

If not associated with any pain and not severe, you don’t require anti-pyretics.  People just do it because it makes them feel like they’re doing something sometimes.  We also know now that the fever isn’t needed for most infections.\n\nYour body also has an extremely complex immune system.  Fever is part of the primitive response.  Primitive response reacts first while the more complex processes ramp up.  Macrophages start devouring viruses and bacteria and present pieces  of them to T cells.  T cells then bind to plasma cells when ramp up their production.  It also provides the plasma cell the information it needs to produce antibodies.  Antibodies are secreted and attach to the viruses and bacteria.  Once they are, “tagged,” the immune system swarms these cells and kills them rapidly.  This can take 10-14 days usually.  I’ve grossly oversimplified it leaving out numerous cell types, but this is the main process to eliminate infection.\n\nAs for taking things to alleviate symptoms.  A viral upper respiratory infection causing a cough is just inflammation of the airways.  Suppressing the cough with something like dextromethorphan does not delay the dealing process.  Ibuprofen for a headache from the flu doesn’t impede the immune response.  This logic is generally true for most common infections, but not all infections.  You definitely don’t want to take Imodium if you might have C. diff!","143":"The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work.\n\nThe bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). \n\nIt's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work.\n\nThe square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume grows faster (cubically) than surface (squarly), which also (usually) means that mass will grow faster than the support structure for that mass. An elephants weight is supported by its bones, muscles etc. If you scaled it up the bones would get bigger too, but the mass of the bones would get bigger faster, and at some point, it would get too much. If you wanted a bigger elephant, you'd need to change how much bone it has compared to It's body size (not just how much bone it has compared to a smaller elephant). The reason real elephants can't get any bigger is that when a new one is born, evolution doesn't go on a character select screen and pick what kind of bone-to-mass ratio it would want. It's stuck with what it has, at least for now.\n\nEdit: Just to address this, because people keep posting bits and pieces of it in the replies: yes, the square-cube law has many more biological implications than just collapsing under your own weight because your bones and what not were not prepared to handle it. That's just the most common thing you hear when people talk about it in popularization, because it's kinda fun, in a morbid way. \n\nOne other thing that becomes a problem, and you can see this very well with elephants specifically, is that as you grow, you become to have cooling problems, since you gradually have less and less skin to disipate the heat, proportional to how much you're producing. That's why elephants have such huge ears. But there's many other implications, such as not being able to absorb enough oxygen, because your lungs are too small, not being able process nutrients fast enough, because you don't have enough gut surface... Really anything that has anything to do with the surface or cross section of an organ will become problematic if you scale an animal up or down.","144":"I am a musician and also a truck driver. I tend to compose music in my head and my profession allows me a lot of time to do this. When I get home from the road, I sit at my computer and open my DAW and often finish several songs in a short period of time. I just have to get them out! \n\nIt’s interesting though in that the composing in my head is also something I do to stay alert while on the road. It helps to stay focused on my surroundings. There are other things as well like making it a routine to scan the gauges on the truck, check your mirrors, shift your perspective from constantly looking dead in front of you to the far distance, registering differences in the sound and feel of the road. With me the mental exercise of the music is part of that.\n\nIt’s interesting to me, a lot of long distance truck drivers tent to be reactionary prima donnas. We have a lot of time to be lost in our heads and some guys seem to brood on small problems and make them into huge issues. I’m not like that and most of my friends in the business are not and they are also creative people but not necessarily musicians. I think those of us who do any kind of positive mental activity over those long hours seem to be less reactionary.

The trachea (gases) and esophagus (solids\/liquids) are layered together. There are muscles and valves that close off to make sure liquid or solids don’t enter the lungs while swallowing or vice versa air into the stomach while breathing. And why you shouldn’t try to breathe in while drinking liquids (like drinking while heavy panting after exercise or thinking water will help while choking…) When you either accidentally override the automatic muscle closures or are too incapacitated to close those muscles properly anymore you get what’s called “aspiration”. Small enough and your lungs can get rid of it eventually on their own through coughing and the complex system of blood vessels and such- but a large enough or nasty enough thing gets inhaled and the stagnant aspiration becomes “aspiration pneumonia” and infects your lungs becoming so thick and gnarly you need antibiotics and steroid medications to help solve it. Sometimes the lung ends up with even worse infections or holes, and you need chest tubes or a whole crazy world of life saving treatments. That’s the long, short of it.  -source am nurse","146":"The answers so far are crappy.\n\nYes the kidneys regulate blood pressure, and if that drops due to losing blood, they will simply stop producing urine to keep all the water inside the body and dilute the remaining blood to keep the pressure up, so it still goes places.\n\n\nBut that’s not actually the body replacing the blood. That just the body going oh shit and throwing a lot of water at the issue as a stop gap.\n\nThe kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin (called epo when talking about doping in sports). They produce more of there’s less oxygen in the bloood. Which happens when the blood is diluted, because you lost blood, and it wS simply filled back up with water.\n\n\nThis hormone goes to the bone marrow and causes it to produce more red blood cells.\n\n\nOnce the kidneys sense there’s enough oxygen in the blood, they will go back to the basic maintenance levels of producing erythropoietin, and the bone marrow just produces as many new red blood cells as naturally get recycled after 3 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this mechanism is tightly regulated, you only produce more blood than needed if some disease messes with these systems, or you artificially inject EPO.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s pretty much how everything in our bodies is regulated.\n\nOrgan A senses some property, and release an amount of a hormone that’s proportional to the level of the property, which tells some other organ to produce XYZ which fixes the issue.\n\n\nWhich is also why we develop tolerances to very many drugs: if you change the balance at the wrong point, the body will just adjust its messaging to compensate for the drug messing with its balance.\n\nIf the drug goes beyond the capabilities of the body to balance things, it’ll work permanently, or if it makes it so the body doesn’t notice the balance has shifted.","147":"There are several sources. Here the are in (probable) order of importance.\n\n1. You're constantly losing water. You're losing it through your skin and you're breathing it out.\n2. Your scale isn't that precise. It's going to vary by a certain amount because you're standing differently, the temperature changed, etc.\n3. You're burning fats and sugars and part of your metabolism. Those are turning into CO2 and water, and the CO2 is being breathed out.\n4. You're shedding skin flakes constantly to feed your pet dust mites in your mattress. This is probably not even worth mentioning in terms of weight loss, but it's a fun image. :) The mites must feed!\n\nEdit: Wait. scratch #3. I've seen it listed, but it's wrong when you actually do the math (which I just did) To use an example, when your body burns 1 gram of stearic acid (C18H36O2), it produces about 1.2g of water and 2.7 g CO2, but you had to take in 2.9g of oxygen for the reaction. Since the water isn't immediately removed, you're actually gaining wait in the form of water.\n\nEdit2: Yes. sugars is a net loss, but it's at least partly cancelled by fat oxidation, and still small compared to water loss. The average person burns 300-600 calories a night. 450 calories of 100% glucose releases about 165g of carbon. The average person loses 500-1000g a night. It's still mostly water, even if you have somehow lost the ability to burn fat.","148":"JESUS CHRIST.  These are the most confidently incorrect answers I've seen in a while.\n\nOf the five main types of Asbestos fiber, the most commonly used type is Crysotile.\n\nThe main hazardous characteristic of it is that when it becomes *fryable* the fibers tend to break into shards that have a weird physical structure that results in the ends of the fragments to have curled, hook-like ends that resemble microscopic velcro.\n\nThe hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively. This results in the particles remaining in the body for MUCH longer, and that causes a body to resort to other means of self-preservation, such as encapsulation.\n\nWhen the body encapsulates an asbestos fiber, it deposits calcium around it and forms a layer of scar tissue around the deposit.\n\nOne or two fibers isn't much of a problem, but people who have repeatedly been exposed to airborne particulates over linger periods of time, can have their lung tissues saturated with these asbestos-calcium deposits. Scar tissue cannot support oxygen\/CO2 exchange, so having your lungs filled with scar tissue can cause a person to lose a significant percentage of usable lung tissue. (I used to work with an old-timer industrial insulator who only had 30% of one lung left.)\n\nThis is called Asbestosis. It is a chronic condition and there is no treatment.\n\nThe other serious concern with Asbestos is that having asbestos in your lungs has been linked with an incredibly high increase in occurrence of lung cancer (80 times. 400x if you're a smoker) and worse than that is the linked likelihood of developing Mesothelioma, which is, IMHO, the scariest kind of cancer possible. It's cancer of the lining of internal organs, which means that it's almost guaranteed to metastasize before you even know you have it. It's a death sentence with a short timer, and it'll waste a human into a husk faster than pancreatic cancer.","149":"One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They mention that episodic memories usually start around 3-4 years of age.\n\nSome people mentioned how memory is linked to language, but this isn't proven. If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it.\n\nLanguage may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones. An episodic memory is basically \"this specific thing happened\". You do however form associative memories. These are more general and are the type that go: \"If I cry, caregiver will give me attention\", \"cat hurts\", \"shape goes into the square hole\". It also includes language, and you could argue that language strengthens associative language.\n\nIn this fase we learn what things are, but you don't really need language to recognize a cat, just to call it a cat. You just have to see a cat enough times to form a concept of cat in your head, and thus you recognize it as something distinct from a bowl or an apple.\n\nThese concepts are important for episodic memory; if you don't know what a cat or an apple is, it is hard to form a memory that goes: \"my cat jumped on the counter and knocked over a bowl of apples\".\n\nIf you were attacked by a cat before the age of three you might be scared of cats because the event may have formed your concept of what a cat is, but you won't necessarily have an episodic memory of it happening."},"id":{"0":0,"1":1,"2":2,"3":3,"4":4,"5":5,"6":6,"7":7,"8":8,"9":9,"10":10,"11":11,"12":12,"13":13,"14":14,"15":15,"16":16,"17":17,"18":18,"19":19,"20":20,"21":21,"22":22,"23":23,"24":24,"25":25,"26":26,"27":27,"28":28,"29":29,"30":30,"31":31,"32":32,"33":33,"34":34,"35":35,"36":36,"37":37,"38":38,"39":39,"40":40,"41":41,"42":42,"43":43,"44":44,"45":45,"46":46,"47":47,"48":48,"49":49,"50":50,"51":51,"52":52,"53":53,"54":54,"55":55,"56":56,"57":57,"58":58,"59":59,"60":60,"61":61,"62":62,"63":63,"64":64,"65":65,"66":66,"67":67,"68":68,"69":69,"70":70,"71":71,"72":72,"73":73,"74":74,"75":75,"76":76,"77":77,"78":78,"79":79,"80":80,"81":81,"82":82,"83":83,"84":84,"85":85,"86":86,"87":87,"88":88,"89":89,"90":90,"91":91,"92":92,"93":93,"94":94,"95":95,"96":96,"97":97,"98":98,"99":99,"100":100,"101":101,"102":102,"103":103,"104":104,"105":105,"106":106,"107":107,"108":108,"109":109,"110":110,"111":111,"112":112,"113":113,"114":114,"115":115,"116":116,"117":117,"118":118,"119":119,"120":120,"121":121,"122":122,"123":123,"124":124,"125":125,"126":126,"127":127,"128":128,"129":129,"130":130,"131":131,"132":132,"133":133,"134":134,"135":135,"136":136,"137":137,"138":138,"139":139,"140":140,"141":141,"142":142,"143":143,"144":144,"145":145,"146":146,"147":147,"148":148,"149":149}}
