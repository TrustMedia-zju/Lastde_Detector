I think it needs to stay the same, but they just need to make it actually scary. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get out alive though.\nThat's what it feels like.  The point of writing anything in fiction should be to scare the reader.  Make it so that at the end of the story the reader is thinking \"fuck, I was *sure* that was dead!\" and thinking \"That's a damn good ending for a scary story.\"  This one is pretty close though.  It's better than a lot of the endings out there, although you can see it coming with the end.",

It would also be up to the animals to determine whether their actions were legal or not.

However, what Zuckerberg neglects to acknowledge is that the world is not going to go back to pre-social media before Facebook.
