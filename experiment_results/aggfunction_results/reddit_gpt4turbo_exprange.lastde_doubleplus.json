There had to be a benefit at some point, so what could it be? Historically, the design and shape of shoes have often been influenced by fashion trends rather than ergonomic factors. Narrow shoes have long been associated with an aesthetic of elegance and refinement. In many cultures, slim and pointed footwear was considered fashionable and symbolic of a higher social status. This trend likely spurred the production of narrower shoes to meet societal expectations and preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the manufacturing process of shoes can play a role. Narrower shoes can be less costly to produce because they require less material and can be simpler to design and assemble than wider, more ergonomically shaped footwear. This economic benefit may have encouraged manufacturers to lean towards producing slimmer designs.\n\nHowever, the prolonged wearing of narrow shoes can indeed lead to negative alterations in foot structure, such as bunions, hammertoes, and other orthopedic issues. Awareness of these health implications has grown, and there is now a greater demand for shoes that fit well and support natural foot anatomy. As consumer preferences shift towards comfort and health, the footwear industry is adapting, increasingly focusing on ergonomics alongside style in shoe design", "sampled_crit": 1.3415099382400513}, {"original": "If we use alcohol as disinfectant, why drinking it doesnt solve throat infection / sore throat? Many reasons. - a throat infection isn't bacterial or viral accumulation on the surface, it's usually lymph nodes swelling in response to chemicals released by the infection as your body takes action to fight the infection. - if it does kill anything it will be surface level membranes and cells. - the alcohol needs to be pretty strong and it still needs time to take effect. - just about anything can kill bacteria and viruses pretty easily....

Many reasons contribute to this. First, a throat infection isn't necessarily bacterial; it can also be viral, such as the common cold or flu, against which alcohol is ineffective. Drinking alcohol does not maintain a high enough concentration in the throat area long enough to kill bacteria effectively. Alcohol used in disinfectants is typically isopropyl alcohol, which is not safe for ingestion, whereas the alcohol consumed in beverages is ethanol, which is diluted in drinks and not present at concentrations high enough to have a significant antibacterial effect.\n\nMoreover, consuming alcohol can actually weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection. Alcohol can also dehydrate the body; hydration is crucial for the recovery and maintenance of health during illness. Alcohol might provide a temporary numbing effect on the sore throat due to its sedative properties, but this does not address the underlying infection or inflammation and could potentially worsen the symptoms once the numbing wears off.\n\nTherefore, while alcohol serves well as a surface disinfectant, it does not function effectively or safely as a treatment for throat infections when ingested.", "sampled_crit": -0.17146678268909454}, {"original": "The lower your resting heart rate, the better. True? Why? There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake himself up during the night so he can exercise to get his heart rate up again. Otherwise, he could die in his sleep. EDIT: AI fact check: The story you might be thinking of is about Marco Pantani, a legendary Italian cyclist who had severe bradycardia. While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night. While there are reports of him occasionally using a stationary bike at night to manage his condition, it wasn't a regular practice. In fact, he preferred training outdoors during the day. Here are some key points to clarify: Pantani's bradycardia was a medical condition, not typical for all cyclists. Most cyclists, while having lower resting heart rates than average, wouldn't experience such extreme bradycardia. He didn't use an alarm specifically for nighttime exercise.

There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake him if his heart rate drops too low in his sleep. Does this mean that a very low resting heart rate is always a sign of good health?\n\nThe lower your resting heart life, the better. True? Well, not necessarily. While a lower resting heart rate can be a sign of excellent cardiovascular fitness, particularly in athletes like professional cyclists, it is not a definitive marker of better health for everyone. Athletes often train intensively to improve their heart muscle strength, which can result in a lower resting heart rate because their hearts pump a larger volume of blood with each beat, requiring fewer beats per minute to maintain a steady flow.\n\nHowever, extremely low resting heart rates, especially below 40 beats per minute, can sometimes indicate issues such as bradycardia, a condition where the heart does not pump enough oxygen-rich blood around the body. Symptoms of bradycardia include fatigue, dizziness, and fainting spells.

Great question! Disclamer, I am not a professional at all, but I've had advanced/expanded biology classes in a polish highschool so I know a thing or two. Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva. You know that feeling of your mouth watering when you look at/smell something delicious? That's the first stage of digestion preparing itself for the work ahead.

When we eat, food is broken down into various components, including carbohydrates. In the stomach, carbohydrates are partially digested, but no significant absorption of glucose occurs there. The process of digestion primarily serves to prepare food for absorption in the small intestine by converting it into a semi-liquid form called chyme.\n\nAs chyme enters the small intestine, carbohydrates are further broken down into simpler sugars like glucose through the action of enzymes. The small intestine is highly efficient at absorbing glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream, leading to an increase in blood sugar levels. This absorption begins quite soon after food consumption, not necessarily several hours later. The presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the pancreas to release insulin, which helps cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy.\n\nMoreover, the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream can vary based on the type of carbohydrates consumed.

When you breathe through your nose, the air is warmed and humidified before it reaches the lungs.

In diving, decompression illness encompasses several different conditions, primarily decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism, both of which can be fatal. Decompression sickness, often known as \"the bends,\" occurs when divers ascend too quickly.

As long as the roots have access to sufficient oxygen, water propagation can be a successful method. Typically, when propagating, only a portion of the plant (often a cut stem or leaf) is placed in water, allowing it to develop roots. This method is effective because the water provides a consistent moisture source directly to the areas that need it, without the risk of fungal diseases often associated with soil due to overwatering.\n\nOverwatering plants in soil, however, can be detrimental because it leads to a lack of oxygen in the root zone. When soil is too wet, air pockets are filled with water, reducing the oxygen available to the roots. This lack of oxygen can cause roots to suffocate, decay, and eventually die, which harms the entire plant. Additionally, overly moist soil conditions can promote the growth of root rot pathogens, which further damage the plant.

However, several factors contribute to the exceptional cognitive abilities observed in humans. One significant factor is the size and complexity of the human brain, particularly the neocortex, which is the region responsible for higher-order functions like reasoning, planning, and language. This area is much more developed in humans than in any other species. Additionally, the human brain has a high degree of plasticity, meaning it can adapt and reorganize neural pathways based on new experiences, which enhances learning and problem-solving abilities.\n\nAnother important aspect is the prolonged developmental period of human children, which allows for an extended learning phase. This extended period of brain plasticity and development enables the accumulation and transmission of complex cultural and technological knowledge across generations, further enriching intellectual growth. Moreover, humans have evolved sophisticated communication skills, not just in terms of complex language but also through facial expressions and body language, which facilitate nuanced social interactions and cooperation.

While it's true that plants in nature grow in an environment with seemingly limitless soil, they also have natural mechanisms and ecological conditions that regulate their growth. In the wild, plants compete with others for resources, which naturally controls their root expansion and nutrient uptake.\n\nIn contrast, potted plants are confined to a limited space and depend entirely on the pot's soil for nutrients and water. Over-potting refers to the practice of planting a small plant in a disproportionately large pot. This can lead to several problems that don't typically affect plants in nature. First, the excess soil in the pot retains more water than the plant's roots can use, which can lead to waterlogging, reduced oxygen availability to the roots, and an increased risk of root rot.

This phenomenon is explained by a principle known as Fisher's Principle, which was formulated by the British geneticist Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century. According to Fisher, natural selection favors a 1:1 sex ratio because it maximizes the number of grandchildren. This principle hinges on the idea that if there is a deviation in the ratio, for instance, more males than females, then females will have a higher reproductive value due to their scarcity. Consequently, parents genetically inclined to produce females will have a greater chance of having a larger number of grandchildren, thereby passing on more of their genes. Over time, this selective advantage leads to a restoration of the 1:1 ratio. Conversely, if there are more females than males, then producing males becomes more advantageous.

Firstly, heart cells, or cardiomyocytes, are highly specialized and do not frequently divide. Cancer typically arises from cells that are rapidly dividing and mutating, which is less common in adult heart cells. Secondly, the heart has a unique environment with a very high demand for oxygen and continuous activity, which might not be conducive to the survival of cancerous cells.\n\nThere are also other organs where cancer is exceedingly rare, though not entirely absent. For example, cancers of the small intestine are uncommon despite it being a large organ with a rapid cell turnover rate. This paradox might be explained by the high level of immunological activity in the gut, which could prevent the growth of cancer cells. Moreover, some tissues like hair and nails are composed of dead cells, thus they do not get cancer at all. \n\nUnderstanding why certain tissues rarely develop cancer can help researchers discover new ways to prevent or treat cancer in more commonly affected organs.

If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work.

However, dinosaurs such as titanosaurs could grow to immense sizes due to several evolutionary, anatomical, and ecological adaptations that differ significantly from those of modern animals like elephants. First, the skeletal structure of dinosaurs was distinctively adapted to support large bodies. Titanosaurs, for instance, had extremely light, air-filled bones which reduced the overall body weight while maintaining structural strength. Additionally, the configuration of their limbs, being more columnar and directly under the body, provided more efficient support for a massive body compared to the sprawling limbs of some large reptiles or the angled limbs of elephants.\n\nMoreover, the environment during the Mesozoic era, when dinosaurs thrived, was conducive to the evolution of large body sizes. Higher oxygen levels and extensive vegetation provided the necessary resources for sustaining large herbivores.

This is an age-old question, and there are several possible answers, each depending on the specific circumstances of the lake's location and its connection to other bodies of water. One common way fish end up in lakes is through natural waterways like rivers and streams. Fish naturally migrate, often swimming upstream from larger bodies of water like seas or other rivers, and can end up in a lake that's connected to these waterways.\n\nAnother way fish can populate a lake is through the process of flooding. When rivers overflow during heavy rains, fish can be swept along with the floodwaters and deposited into nearby lakes. Once the floodwaters recede, the fish find themselves in a new environment where they can thrive if conditions are suitable.\n\nHuman activity also plays a significant role in the distribution of fish across different water bodies. Fish stocking is a common practice where humans intentionally release fish into lakes to establish a population for recreational fishing, conservation, or to help maintain the ecosystem.

Several factors contribute to this alarming trend. Firstly, there has been an increase in chronic health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, which complicate pregnancy and childbirth. These conditions are more prevalent in the U.S. compared to decades past, partly due to changes in lifestyle and an aging maternal population, where more women over the age of 35 are giving birth.\n\nAdditionally, disparities in healthcare access and quality play a critical role. Women from minority groups, particularly African American women, experience higher rates of maternal mortality due to factors including systemic racism, socioeconomic disparities, and less access to adequate prenatal care. These issues are compounded by a lack of standardized care across healthcare facilities and a shortage of healthcare providers who specialize in maternal and reproductive health.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the variation in how maternal mortality data is collected and reported.

Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose.

Say a kid and an adult are both asked to run as far as they can. The kid, more often than not, will run longer distances without showing signs of fatigue compared to the adult. This phenomenon can be explained by several physiological and psychological factors.\n\nFirstly, children have a higher ratio of slow-twitch to fast-twitch muscle fibers. Slow-twitch fibers are more efficient at using oxygen to generate fuel for continuous, extended muscle contractions over a long time. They are less likely to fatigue, which naturally bestows children with a greater endurance capacity. Additionally, children typically have faster recovery times due to their higher metabolic rates and more resilient bodies, allowing them to bounce back quickly from physical exertion.\n\nPsychologically, children also differ from adults in terms of their perception of physical activity.

First, the biological processes involved in male and female reproduction are quite different. In females, contraception generally involves preventing the release of a single egg each month, a process that is relatively straightforward to target with hormonal medications. In contrast, male reproductive biology involves the continuous production of millions of sperm cells, making it more challenging to develop an effective and reversible method to stop sperm production without causing significant side effects.\n\nAnother challenge is the hormonal difference between men and women. Female contraceptives often work by manipulating hormones like estrogen and progesterone. For males, targeting the equivalent hormone, testosterone, often leads to undesirable side effects such as mood swings, changes in libido, and long-term health risks like cardiovascular issues.\n\nAdditionally, there has been less financial and cultural incentive to develop male contraceptives. Historically, the burden of contraception has predominantly been placed on women, and this has influenced both research focus and funding. Changing this perspective takes time and societal shift.\n\nFinally, the market for male contraceptives is uncertain, which makes pharmaceutical companies hesitant", "sampled_crit": 2.6016666889190674}, {"original": "Why can we get HIV to a viral load of 0 but can't get rid of the virus?

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be suppressed to undetectable levels in the blood through the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This means that the viral load, or the amount of virus in the blood, is so low that it cannot be detected by standard testing methods. Achieving an undetectable viral load is crucial as it helps prevent disease progression and reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHowever, despite this effective suppression, HIV cannot be completely eradicated from the body. The primary reason lies in the ability of HIV to integrate its genetic material into the DNA of host cells, forming what are known as viral reservoirs.

In this context we prefer to use the term gamete competition instead of sperm competition, as sperm only exist after the sexes have already diverged (Lessells et al., 2009). To see this, we must be clear about how the two sexes are defined in a broad sense: males are those individuals that produce the smaller gametes (e.g. sperm), while females are defined as those that produce the larger gametes (e.g. Parker et al., 1972; Bell, 1982; Lessells et al., 2009; Togashi and Cox, 2011).

In the animal kingdom, the designation of male or female typically depends on whether an organism produces sperm (male) or eggs (female), which are the gametes required for reproduction. In the case of seahorses, it is the male that carries the babies, but it is still the female that produces the eggs.\n\nThe unique reproductive role of male seahorses involves a specialized brood pouch where the female deposits her eggs. After the male fertilizes these eggs internally, he carries them in his pouch until they hatch, providing a safe environment where the embryos develop. The process includes regulating the water salinity within the pouch to match external conditions, providing oxygen, and even expelling the fully developed young seahorses at the end of the gestation period.\n\nThis fascinating inversion of typical pregnancy roles challenges our standard perceptions of male and female roles in nature but adheres to the biological definitions based on", "sampled_crit": 0.5165865421295166}, {"original": "What happens to your body when you participate in a marathon Long distance running problems/risks (and the things you describe) in no particular order: 1.

Long distance running, such as participating in a marathon, brings about a myriad of physiological changes and can pose certain health risks if not properly managed. Firstly, the intense endurance demand significantly stresses the cardiovascular system. The heart rate increases to pump more oxygenated blood to muscles, which can be taxing, especially for those with underlying heart conditions. \n\nMusculoskeletal injuries are common, including stress fractures, muscle strains, and joint pain, particularly in the knees, hips, and ankles. This is due to the repetitive impact over the extended period of running. Furthermore, the risk of systemic issues such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (like sodium and potassium) increases. These elements are crucial for muscle function and blood chemistry, and their depletion can lead to cramps, dizziness, and more severe conditions like hyponatremia.\n\nEnergy depletion is another critical aspect. The body burns through stored glycogen and may start breaking down fat and even muscle tissue, which can lead to fatigue and reduced physical performance.

You get frostbite only when the body can\u2019t produce enough heat to counteract the cold environment, which is something athletes actively manage. When athletes play in temperatures around 0\u00b0 Celsius (32\u00b0 Fahrenheit) with parts of their skin exposed, they rely on several physiological and strategic methods to maintain body heat and performance. First, during intense physical activity, the body generates significant heat through metabolic processes. Muscles working hard produce heat as a byproduct of energy expenditure, which helps to keep the body warm even in cold conditions.\n\nAdditionally, athletes often use specialized gear and clothing designed to retain body heat while still allowing for mobility and sweat evaporation. This might include compression garments that help maintain muscle temperature without covering them completely. Layering also plays a crucial role; athletes can wear breathable yet insulating layers that they can remove or add depending on their warmth needs and the intensity of their activity.\n\nMoreover, many athletes acclimatize themselves to colder temperatures as part of their training, which can enhance their body's physiological responses to cold, including improved blood circulation to the extremities and increased metabolic rate.

When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy. This chemical that glycogen combines with is called lactate and it's the reason why your muscles start to burn when you start working out with a lot of intensity. Once you adjust to higher intensities, your body produces less lactate (it's a byproduct of generating energy without oxygen) and your muscles can work at a higher intensity without \"burning\".

The adaptations that occur in our bodies are extensive and vital for increasing endurance. First, the heart muscle strengthens, enabling it to pump more blood per beat. This increased stroke volume delivers more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles and removes carbon dioxide and other waste materials more efficiently. Additionally, the total volume of blood in the body increases, further enhancing cardiovascular capacity.\n\nThe muscles also undergo significant changes. The number of capillaries, the small blood vessels within the muscle tissues, increases, improving the delivery of oxygen and the removal of waste products. The muscles' ability to utilize oxygen also improves due to an increase in mitochondrial density. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell where energy production occurs, and having more of them means that the muscles can produce more energy aerobically.\n\nFurthermore, regular cardio training leads to an increase in the production of enzymes that are involved in the aerobic energy pathway.

Primarily, the human skin, even when injured, does not readily absorb water because it's made up of multiple layers designed to protect internal organs and prevent the entry of foreign substances. When the skin is cut, the body immediately responds to seal the injury. Blood clotting is the first defense, where platelets (a type of blood cell) aggregate at the injury site to form a clot. This clot acts as a barrier, not only helping to stop the bleeding but also preventing external substances, including water, from entering the bloodstream.\n\nMoreover, the pressure exerted by the body's internal fluids is generally higher than the surrounding water pressure, which helps keep water from being forced into the wound.
