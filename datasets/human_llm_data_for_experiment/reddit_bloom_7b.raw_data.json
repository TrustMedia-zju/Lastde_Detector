It\u2019s really amazing how much there is to growing plants\u2026 Personal anecdotes: Boss got us a bunch of plants in my old job\u2019s office, and we distributed them around, pretty much like \u201coh, this one looks great over here!\u201d We also assigned daily watering duty, and even weekly \u201cleaves care\u201d, when we would spray water on the leaves and wiped off dust. Fast forward a few months, some of the plants did great, while others looked almost dead. Boss took the almost dead ones home and put them on their porch like balcony (rooftop apartment), and they came back to life! Some more research was done, and we realized that (as a rule of thumb) big leaves means the plant is probably used to grow in low light under bigger trees, while small leaves means they need a lot more daylight. Back into our office the plants go, and we put the small",

I tend to compose music in my head and my profession allows me a lot of time to do this. When I get home from the road, I sit at my computer and open my DAW and often finish several songs in a short period of time. I just have to get them out! It\u2019s interesting though in that the composing in my head is also something I do to stay alert while on the road. It helps to stay focused on my surroundings. There are other things as well like making it a routine to scan the gauges on the truck, check your mirrors, shift your perspective from constantly looking dead in front of you to the far distance, registering differences in the sound and feel of the road. With me the mental exercise of the music is part of that.",
        "if a human being was born in the wild and left alone. When this person grows to be able to think, would they think using a language of their own or would they just develop an understanding of the world around? The language you speak has far, far more impact on the way you think than you probably are even aware of. It helps you internalise your thinking and make sense of your experiences. You can reflect on things that just happened and analyse the past to learn and grow, and also can comprehend that a future exists and begin to understand how it could pan out. It alters your perception of literally the tiniest experiences, and I mean not just knowing language, but people who speak different languages think differently because of the way their brain processes information. Also being outside of human contact would mean zero social skills and missing out in",
        "Refrigerate after opening, but not before? You're right about most dairy products being only pasteurized except for UHT milk in those box containers, and most cheeses have a low enough water activity measurement that they do not need to be heat treated after packaging. I believe though that mayonnaise is a commercially sterilized food so even though it is not in a'can', it is still considered a canned food. It has to be because it is basically egg white, oil, and water. I could be mistaken. Ketchup is weird because the salt/sugar content may make the water availability too low but I believe they are commercially sterilized (which isn't the same thing as'sterilized'). Mustard again is weird because mustard itself has antimicrobial properties inherent in it, so again, it may not need heat processing. Many foods not packaged in a can are still considered to be canned foods because they have undergone commercial sterilization. Sometimes foods",

        "the process that drives a typical spider Jeff is big and sedentary? Sounds like Jeff is a girl. Male spiders are smaller and less likely build their own webs and eventually leave them to try and find a female to mate with. A dangerous pursuit as the females often eat them afterwards or even during. Spiders do most of their behaviour by instinct, which is a sort of genetic hard wiring of the synapses. Instead of forming and reinforcing connections between neurons by learning, experience, and a chemical reward/punishment system they are formed embryonically in a pattern stored in the DNA. This means that spiders can build species specific webs, perform species specific mating dances and know how to hunt prey or escape predators, all without learning a thing and without ever seeing another spider do it first. That's",
        "Why do most people have no memories from before age 4 or 5 years old? One factor is of course that the brain takes time to develop. They mention that episodic memories usually start around 3-4 years of age. Some people mentioned how memory is linked to language, but this isn't proven. If it were true, people who learned language late would naturally start to form memories later. This correlation would be possible to check for, but I don't know if anyone has done it. Language may be a contributing factor, but I think it mostly comes down to the fact that you are *do* actually have memories from before you're 3-4, just not *episodic* ones. An episodic memory is basically \"this specific thing happened\". You do however form associative memories. These are more general and are the type that go: \"If I cry, caregiver will give me attention\", \"cat hurts\", \"shape goes into the square hole\". It also includes language, and you could argue that language strengthens associative language. In this fase we learn what things are, but you don't really need language to recognize a cat,",
        "How do people actually die from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease? Most deaths are from Alzheimers patients not being able to take care of themselves and having accidents or untreated illnesses. A good nursing home can help this but without being able to get any help from the patient it becomes an impossible task to take care of them. A small infection for example which could be deadly for a senior citizen without medical attention might go unnoticed for days if the patient is not able to complain about pains. Even leaving a seriously ill Alzheimer patient unattended for a few minutes at night could cause you to miss them jumping on their bed falling over and braking bones, which for seniors could be fatal as their body does not heal the same way as adults. But even with the best of care Alzheimers is still deadly on its own. The disease is destroying",
        "The lower your resting heart rate, the better. True? Why? There is (was?) a pro cyclist who has to set an alarm to wake himself up during the night so he can exercise to get his heart rate up again. Otherwise, he could die in his sleep. EDIT: AI fact check: The story you might be thinking of is about Marco Pantani, a legendary Italian cyclist who had severe bradycardia. While it's true that cyclists often have lower heart rates due to their training, Pantani's case was extreme. His resting heart rate could drop as low as 28 beats per minute (bpm), which is dangerously low and can even be fatal. However, he didn't set an alarm specifically to exercise at night. While there are reports of him occasionally using a stationary bike at night to manage his condition, it wasn't a regular practice. In fact, he preferred training outdoors during the day. Here are some key points to clarify: Pantani's bradycardia was a medical condition, not typical",

It\u2019s not just that there is bacteria, it\u2019s that your immune system attacks the bacteria to prevent you from getting an infection. The bone gets caught in the crossfire. Once the bone drops away the gum follows. Reducing the bacterial load reduces the chances of perio disease, however some peoples immune system is super sensitive and will cause perio even with smaller amounts of bacteria, while others will brush minimally and their immune system doesn\u2019t freak out. I have a patient who is the most meticulous person I\u2019ve met and her hygiene is clearly as meticulous, two of her back molars were lost due to perio. I have other patients where the only time bacteria is disturbed is when I drill their teeth to do a filling and their bone is as solid as rock. Unfortunately once bone is lost from perio it is difficult to restore, the more common treatment is to",
        "Why do men have bigger feet in contrast to women? Why aren't their average foot sizes equal? An important note is that in addition to height differences, difference in muscle mass, and composition, as well as general bone structure especially in the pelvis and knees, mean that men's feet are designed for a very very different kind of moving. Men's feet tend to be proportionally longer than women's feet for their width (one of the reasons men and women use different size scales). Generally, men's feet are designed to be more tolerant of intense load while moving with speed and force. Think, running, striking, jumping, quickly changing direction etc. Meanwhile, women's feet are more generally suited for stability and continuous use while carrying a moderate load, ie a child either born or in the womb. Women's feet are generally rounder, and adapted for a shorter gait and wider hips. This contributes to more efficient walking, standing, and less wear and effort expended on joints and muscles in the legs. Women's feet are",
        "Why can't we just spend however long it takes to brush our teeth over and over again until they're as clean and white as they were when we first got them? (Like dentist office billboard advertisement levels of white teeth) Stains aren't the same thing as plaque or dirt. Staining is in the tooth like dye on cloth, not on the tooth like paint on a wall. One of the best ways to prevent teeth from darkening is to simply swish with water after drinking your coffee or tea (or brush your teeth if you're at home). That way the residue from the tea/coffee isn't sitting around getting absorbed into the enamel. Teeth need to be whitened with something that can oxygenate the enamel and allow the bleaching effect to take place. That's why most at-home whiteners like Crest White strips or whitening mouthwash contain hydrogen peroxide in the formula, as do most professional whitening solutions available from the dentist. These formulas open the enamel",
        "why do babies sit with perfect posture when they learn to sit, but the older you get, the worse it gets? It\u2019s actually because of 2 reasons. They are also kind of interlinked. - firstly babies have very large heads (relatively) and they have a straight spine (that gets bent in and out as we age - which is normal). Having a large and heavy head and a weak neck will make it very hard to hold the head anywhere other than straight over the rest of the body. You can try wearing a heavy helmet and you\u2019ll see that slouching to look at your phone becomes extremely difficult. - this brings us to the second reason. That is modern society habits. Looking at phones, or writing in schools. We spend a lot of times doing things where we are slouched forward after about age 6,7. This is not natural and this can cause you to just get used to this slouched position. Some muscles become stronger, some weaker and",

        "why do we get sweaty palms if we're doing something dangerous like climbing? Isn't that counter-productive? Similarly, it bothers me when people require a purpose for a specific animal or species to exist. We can assign a benefit to the ecosystem. But it's usually arbitrary. Things just be. And an ecosystem will adapt to an organism no longer existing or being introduced. Even invasive species are just changing the ecosystem. We use language saying those species are *damaging* the ecosystem. But we define what counts as damage or what *should* exist that's being destroyed. If you are just measuring the genetic survivability of an ecosystem, invasive species usually make it hardier. But as humans we hate loss so we see a species that existed, being killed off as damaging. To take it even a step further, when people complain that humans are evil because they damage the environment. No, we change it. There is no objective, structural value",
        "how come after all these thousands of years. Female to male ratio appears to stay a consistent 50/50 ratio? This is called Fisher's principle. Basically in species that reproduce like humans, the sex ratio automatically go to a 50/50 split. The thinking is if anyone in the species had a mutation that would result in more offspring of one gender, that would make the other gender have a greater chances of finding a mate and make having children of that gender preferable to pass on your genese. Whenever there are more men or more women it becomes an advantage to have more kids of the opposite gender. So like a pendulum swinging back and forth it always comes back to the middle. That said 50/50 is not the real ratio in humans. It is just the approximate ratio of humans during their main reproductive years. Humans actually are born with slightly more boys than girls, but because boys die more than girls that is whittled down to parity by the times it comes to",
        "shouldn't you always bleed out during surgery? Hemostasis or the stopping of the flow of blood, is managed in a number of ways. As an example; if you are having knee replacement surgery a surgeon would make an incision along the knee, dissect the tissues down to the join and perform the operation. In order to keep bleeding to a minimum we use a technique called exsanguination. The surgeon places what is essentially a large rubber band around the leg and rolls it up towards the hip, while elevating the leg. This forces the blood out of the limb, similar to how wrapping your finger tightly with a string will turn you finger white (exsanguination). The band is then left in place to prevent blood form flowing into the leg and thus from bleeding into the surgical site. Another way hemostasis is maintain, is through Electrosurgery, commonly referred to as bovie. The use of an electromagnetic current plus the electrical resistance of soft tissue generates heat, this is use to cauterize small bleeding vessels,",

There was no science behind the target of 5 by the way, it was chosen as a nice easy to remember number and obviously eating veg is good for you generally. If you have good kidney function and aren't ill or sweating loads, you don't necessarily need 2 litres of water. Basically the requirements are different person to person. For example my wife drinks about 3-4 litres a day and has done for years. I drink 2-3 cups of hot drink and day and that's it. Her kidneys are used to her regime, mine are for mine.

        "why you never hear about the human heart getting cancer, are there other organs that don\u2019t get cancer? The heart muscle itself, not so much. It's not a rapidly dividing tissue, so it's less prone to developing mutations that would lead to cancer. You can still get cardiac myosarcoma, it's just rare because the cardiac muscle cells don't reproduce like other cell populations - the individual cells tend to get larger (hypertrophy) in response to stressors. Tumors that do arise in heart muscle tend to be congenital, because those cells divide when they form the heart. You can still get cancers that arise from other populations within the heart that do divide more frequently. Hemangiosarcoma is a tumor that develops from the cells that line blood vessels, it does somewhat frequently occur in the right atrium of the heart. You can also develop chemodectomas (tumors of special sensory cells) in the aortic body (which I guess is technically the artery leaving the heart..).

        "your food has mold so you throw it out. Except for cheese, you just cut off that bit and keep going. Why is molded cheese still safe to eat, unlike bread or chicken? There's a combination of reasons. The most significant one is that cheese mold itself usually isn't dangerous. Most varieties of mold that commonly grow on cheese just changd the flavor. They won't really hurt you. The second biggest factor is moisture. Cheeses like ricotta are not safe to eat when they get moldy because of their moisture content. And if you have a hard cheese like cheddar, and it gets wet and then molds, it's also not safe because of the moisture. Then soft cheeses like Brie, you'll get opinions both ways. Some people say it's safe if you cut off a good inch or two. Some say it's not safe at all. I would not eat moldy soft cheese. The third thing is density. The more tightly packs the cheese, the harder it is",

        "Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years? Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. Before germ theory, people believed in Humorism or the four humors. They were yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit. To anyone who finds this interesting: there\u2019s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels. When it separates, you see the dark clots at the bottom (black bile), the red blood cells above that (regular blood), the white",

Given the 5% body weight you say is necessary to occlude a skin capillary (at what blood pressure, by the way, since blood pressure would have a large impact on that), it seems unlikely that simple shifts in stance (eg swaying) would be significant enough to reduce occlusion pressure below critical opening pressure of the capillaries. So why don't the tissues of the sole of the feet become rapidly damaged in people who stand all day? 15 minutes of ischemia is enough to cause cell death, so people who spend hours standing in one place (such as grocery store clerks) should be experiencing numerous lesions on the sole of their foot, no?

        "Why drinking salty water feels dehydrating but hospitals are able to rehydrate people with an IV saline drip? Human blood is naturally salty, however its not nearly as salty as ocean water. What this means is that when you drink pure fresh water (no salt), the salt content in your blood actually gets diluted. This causes salt to get pulled from your various body tissues through osmosis, which means your body actually doesn't hydrate as fast as it otherwise could because it's struggling to balance the salt (and other dissolved chemicals) in your blood to properly maintain homeostasis. On the other hand, if you drink salt water (on the level of ocean water), now your blood gets loaded with salt, which causes",

That means if you can keep it calm, it will be a big softy, and if you fall off one or spook it, it will try to run away. Since horses like to run away from things, we can put them on a very long leash or in a large, round playpen, and just let them run around while we are nearby until they say \"okay, people aren't that bad.\" Zebras on the other hand grew up with lions and crocodiles and other fast-attack ambush hunters.

When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic meaning to urinate/wee) hormone that stops your kidneys from filtering water out of the blood and into your wee, so you produce much less urine overnight. Additionally the reason why holding your bladder is harmful is because the muscles that control the bladder are under subconscious control, so you can\u2019t make the bladder squeeze, all you can do consciously is open the little valve at the tip of your pee hole. The bladder gets signals from the brain to squeeze the urine out when it\u2019s full and pushes on the walls, and when the bladder gets this signal and starts squeezing, your normally run to the bathroom and open that little valve, but if you don\u2019t the bladder will push against a close valve, and this pressure will rise and can damage the seals leading to a leaky bladder later in life.

Human babies are born completely helpless, and they stay almost completely helpless for a few years, and then they still need help for many years after that. This is a really important part of being a human. Human babies are born with really big brains. They need to be born kind of underdeveloped for survival because otherwise their heads would be so big that it would be too dangerous for the mother to give birth to them. Because babies are born not fully developed, instead of having lots of instincts already set up in their brains, they have to be taught how to do almost everything. Almost all human behavior",

In addition to everyone else, I would want to add about the importance of _otoliths._ Otoliths are like tiny little rocks that vertebrates (including fish) have in their inner ear. They reside in what looks like a little ball, and the inside of that ball is very sensitive and sends information to the brain. When a fish is upright, these otoliths lay on the bottom (or belly-side) of the ball, sending this information to their brain. If the fish would be upside down, gravity will cause the balls to fall to the top (or back side) of the ball, which again gets sent to the brain. This is how all vertebrates know what's up and what's down. We also detect movement this way, when they accelerate, the otoliths move, so they know which way they move to. The inner ear is the mechanism how vertebrates orient",

Babies are born with systems that help them learn language. One of these is Universal Grammar.

They take a thermal image, which shows the most heat around those areas. And a lot of people have interpreted this to mean that those areas lose the most heat, which causes this. But the actuality is that people lose the most heat through those areas because it is harder to extensively cover them while still maintaining enough functionality to do anything.

Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further \"injury\" to it. Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less \"inflammation\" (DOMS) to take place. DOMS are not indicative of \"a good workout\" like is commonly perceived.",

Grapefruit, Pommelos, Bergamot oranges and some other less well known *Citrus* fruits contain a compound called Bergamottin. (Note bergamot oranges are unpalatably bitter but they are used to produce fragrant orange oil from their rinds. Other varieties of oranges also contain small amounts of Begamottin in their skins but only small traces are found in the juice and pulp, so aren't generally of concern.) Begamottin acts to inhibit a pair of iron-containing enzymes in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. These are called Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Cytochrome CYP3A4. The functionality of these enzymes is complex, but generally they work to oxidize a broad range of other organic compounds, either reducing their toxicity and breaking them down,(e.g. xanthines like caffeine and theobromine found in chcolate which is toxic to dog and cats) Or else, converting them into more useful molecules, for example, converting Tyramine (found in certain foods)",

In this case your body is the higher pressure container and the ocean is the lower pressure container.

        "How does an alcohol overdose kill you? Hi there. simply put, you have two chemicals that either speed your brain and body up, or slow them down. GABA slows it down, glutamate speeds it up. They work together to keep your breathing, heart rate, and all other body functions at rates that are needed for life. (called homeostasis) Alcohol mimics GABA (which is why it's called a downer, as GABA slows everything down). Alcohol also blocks glutamate, which makes it hard for it to cancel out the alcohol and GABA in your brain. Too much alcohol all at once and you have all brakes and no gas, so your breathing stops. If you drink alcohol excessively for a long long time then the opposite happens, your body makes less GABA and more glutamate. If you suddenly stop drinking then you have all gas and no brakes, and you can have a seizure that won't stop, which will eventually make you stop breathing because the muscles can't coordinate.

The same way when you eat lots of super salty food you will notice the next day your fingers are more swollen, it\u2019s because salt makes your body hold on to fluids making it hard to take a ring off the next day. But if you drink lots of water the day after, you can flush out all that extra salt and now your fingers aren\u2019t swollen and you can remove your rings easily again. Our bodies typically maintain an important balance between how much salt/water circulates on its own, and literally flooding the system with either one will have side effects ranging from minor like swollen fingers to fatal.

This kicks off the message relay, passing a message from one neuron to the next, until it gets to the brain, where we process and experience the stimulus. The stronger the initial stimulation of the first neuron, the more likely the message will get pushed all the way to the brain and be noticed.

I'd love to share this as I understand it! YES, mouth breathing is terrible for you in the following ways: * Mouth acidity and tooth decay: As the dentists have attested, mouth breathing causes evaporation of your saliva. This intensifies the acid in your mouth which dissolves your enamel causing weak spots. It also puts cavity causing bacteria at an advantage over healthy bacteria, so you're more harmed and also less protected. CONVERSELY, a closed mouth can have lots of saliva in it. Saliva, when not too acidic, helps your teeth remineralize by bringing calcium from your food and slowly re-crystalizing your enamel. * Cranio-facial development: Think of your tongue as your body's natural orthodentic palate expander. When you mouth breathe, your tongue is down and you're not wearing your bio-appliance. Over time, without this spreading force across",

If you are only able to eat grass, evolving the ability to eat meat alongside of grass means you outlive everyone else who runs out of grass. A great example of a tradeoff is the abundancy of vitamin C. For most humans, you would probably die from starvation than than die from a lack of vitamin C. It takes about 43 days to starve. Without vitamin C, it takes 90 days to develop scurvy, which doesn't kill you yet, but later if untreated. Creating your own vitamin C requires you to use energy.

We can only say what seems currently likely. Relatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that \"established\" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean. \"Regression to the mean\", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better.

When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color.

Your body digests food by breaking it down into its basic components with enzymes. Fats are broken mostly in the small intestine with bile from your liver, protein is broken mostly by stomach juices which contain an enzyme called, and sugars are mostly broken down with pepsin, an enzyme in your stomach juices, and sugars (carbohydrates) are mainly digested by saliva amylasis which is an enzyme secreted in the mouth and carried by your saliva.

I think the best way to understand why is to start with the fact that storing excess glucose as fat isn't an actual decision in the first place. It's simply the result of chemical reactions. Many innate behavior patterns are pretty much just the animal taking advantage of what chemical reactions their body is capable of performing. So to answer your question, fat will continue to accumulate because there is no mechanism to stop it if there continues to be excess carbohydrate consumption. If blood glucose is above a certain level in the vessels that pass by pancreatic beta cells, insulin is released. Insulin in the blood above a certain level blocks glucagon release. If there is no insulin, then glucagon is constitutively released. Insulin triggers a series of reactions that lead to eventual production of fat. Glucagon leads to breakdown of fat into more glucose.

Your premise is false. Your mouth doesn't just separate food into its constituents. It mashes it into a pastes, that allows saliva to begin the process of digestion. Once the food has been fully broken down into a liquid paste via stomach acid, it passes through the intestines (digestive track) where it is broken down and has its nutrients absorbed.

The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work. The square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume grows faster (cubically) than surface (squarly), which also (usually) means that mass will grow faster than the support structure for that mass.

There's a particular atom that oxygen can really easily bully and keep its electrons, hydrogen. Hydrogen really likes being near oxygen too, because oxygen tends to hang out with electrons and lets it occasionally have some electrons, as a treat, while the other, bigger atoms just steal its electron, or are too lazy to really notice it. One big strong oxygen can take care of a single molecular hydrogen too. Its a pretty great set up for both of them. So when molecular hydrogen and oxygen get to hanging out, it tends to be pretty explosive. Molecular hydrogen, however, is pretty rare here on",
        "if a morbidly obese person suddenly stopped eating anything, and only drank water, would all the fat get burnt before this person eventually dies from starvation? How much longer could that person theoretically survive as compared to an average one? You need the vitamins and minerals that get lost through metabolism and urine. Additionally amino acids cannot be fully recycled so you would need to add those as well, or the body will take apart muscle including the heart muscle to obtain those amino acids (protein = multiple amino acids). If those 3 points are met, then yes the obese person would only starve once their fat storage runs out. Depending on degree of obesity, this will take over a year. Without those vitamins, you will develop conditions like scurvy within a couple of months (hair falls out, wounds don\u2019t heal, old scars break open) as well as other vitamin deficiency disorders.

Are there notable side effects from this? Birth control are synthetic *Progestins* AKA Progestogens that trick the body into thinking it's already pregnant. Normally progestins are produced by the ovaries and uterus in response to the complex ballet of events that occurs during implantation and early pregnancy. Progestins have several effects. It interferes with the development and release of Ova, a.k.a. egg cells, although doesn't, in practice, stop it. It also causes the cervical mucus to thicken making it very difficult, though not impossible for sperm to enter the uterus. Progestins also have numerous other effects on the body, but these are the two effects most relevant. The point of this is essentially push pause on the normal ovulation cycle while the fetus is developing, so you don't end up with a second, concurrent fetus several months later. That would mean labor would not only certainly be fatal to the second fetus, but would",

To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US, compared to other developed countries, has a substantially higher infant mortality rate.

For instance, income disparity only accounts for 30% fo the gap in infant mortality compared to Finland. So, while that is a chunk of the explanation (we have great healthcare, but only if you are that has it AND can afford it). To be fair - I think this may have been obfuscated by some low income jobs having better insurance. One thing this paper didn't touch on was racial disparity in mortality rates.

They sterilize things at the nuns' building before going on calls, but every now and then they need to sterilize as best they can on site. Before about 1860 sterilization of medical equipment wasn't well-known enough to be common; after WWII, births rapidly moved to hospitals in wealthy countries. And today, sterile equipment can be packaged at a central location and sent in plastic packaging to even the most remote areas, plus we can use ethylene oxide, UV light, and portable steam sterilizers that run on batteries. So there's like a 100-year period when boiling water during childbirth to sterilize equipment might possibly be a) known and b) useful. Otherwise it's a trope used for humor, and fair enough!

        "Why are Animals able to gorge themselves with days worth of food, but Humans can't. The notion of \"apex\" predator\" is flawed in a lot of scenarios regarding animals. Young cubs of apex predators are frequently eaten by animals that are ordinarily prey of adult predators. Many mammals steal kills from other species frequently. In South America, the jaguar and the caiman have been shown to co-predate each other, although infrequently. In such a scenario, it is likely that animals eating a big percentage of their body weight in a single meal is a significant stress both in terms of mobility and metabolic stress, leaving them vulnerable to co-predators. This rarely happens because rarely there is an animal that is able to localize and identify such vulnerable individuals to exploit and do opportunistic predation, as well as the risk of injuries. When an animal have higher sociality and engages in more complex cooperative hunting, the ability to handle the stress of large meals is unneeded because",

And is it just older people that should be wearing them? >how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? They squeeze your legs (and everything inside your legs, including the veins and arteries) and help blood return to the heart. By squeezing your blood vessels they reduce the diameter of the vessel, which squirts blood through the vessel faster and with greater volume. Think about holding a garden hose and putting your thumb over the nozzle. You're constricting the flow of the hose, but increasing the speed of the water coming out of the hose. Compression stockings use the same principle to squirt blood through your blood vessels faster. This can be explained with Bernoulli's principle, which states that reducing the diameter around a flowing fluid increases the speed of the fluid.

They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere. There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth.

The most common one that people refer to is the bends, this is when nitrogen comes out of solution in the bodies tissues. This happens because while diving you are under pressure, every 10 meters (or 33.3 feet) you gain one atmosphere of pressure. At sea level the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (approx. 15psi) so a dive to 30 meters (approx. 100 feet) your body is under a total of 4 bar (approx. 60 psi). A rapid ascension would almost certainly cause bubbles to form in the soft tissues (joints, heart, muscle, lungs, etc.) which will cause a lot of pain and potential death.

        "when we improve our cardio, what is it that actually changes within our body for us to be able go from running our first mile to say a marathon? Your body can generate energy to fuel your muscles in different ways. At low intensities, your body can work with oxygen to produce energy and at higher intensities, your body can produce energy without oxygen. When you initially start working out \"cardio\" (aerobic exercising), you will come out of your breath easily and it can take a while for your breathing to normalize again. This happens because you're asking your body to generate energy without oxygen and it needs to adjust. Once you adjust to the higher intensities, your body can generate more energy without going out of breath to generate it. To generate energy without oxygen, your body can combine glucose or fat with oxygen to produce energy or it can combine glycogen with a different chemical to produce energy. This chemical that glycogen combines with is called lactate and it's the reason why your muscles start",

This starts temporarily, but eventually causes permanent damage to the capillaries in the face, causing that rosey red look of a heavy drinker. I am an Allergist. This is garbage. Histamine only causes inflammation in the bloodstream and tissue, not GI tract. Histamine is destroyed by acid and pepsinogen in the stomach and diamine oxidase in the intestines long before it can cross over. Histamine release from mast cells already resident in the body can happen. Still, histamine in your food has no effect whatsoever on histamine levels in the bloodstream, unless you have an enzyme deficiency and even then the evidence is pretty inconclusive.

First, the rate of air flow though the sinuses calls into question the claim that they may protect the lungs in any meaningful manner by'trapping bacteria' (which in itself is a silly statement as sinuses contain a flora of saprophytic bacteria\u2014is it local immune system health that I'd venture to say contributes to sinusitis the most). It would be more apt to say that sinuses protect the lungs indirectly though mucus, if one's pushing that point across. Second, going by the logic that sinuses trap harmful substances/organisms, one might come to a conclusion that we'd better off without having sinuses at all\u2014solely because of the existence of various types of cancer affecting that part of the body. So, in my opinion, the actual answer should go like so: 1. Sinuses produce mucus,'aiding' the immune system. 2. Sinuses humidify the air (which I'd dare say is a point fair more germane to their purported function of protecting lungs than some'bacteria",

Think about a magnet on a table and one below it, you know it's acting on the magnet because you can move it around, but it doesn't pull itself through the table because the table is too strong.

        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory contends that the reason is that not all brains are created equal in terms of how many neurons there are for a given weight of brain. Some animals, like rodents, have little brains and if you count all the neurons inside there really aren't that many in there, even for the weight. Other animals, like crows and ravens, have small brains but if you count all the neurons inside there is rather quite a lot packed into a small space. Let's call that neuron density. Like crows, primates have high neuron density. They have many neurons packed into every ounce of brains they've got. Humans have larger brains than other primates, and a similar neuron density, so we've got a lot of neurons AND a lot of brains.

If you are feeling weak and lightheaded from hunger, and something frightening and truly urgent happens that you have to deal with, you will stop feeling those things almost immediately as your liver starts dumping stored energy as glucose into the bloodstream. There's less stored carbohydrate on hand than stored fat (because it's bulky), but it's also quick enough to pull out, that if the situation warrants it, it can be spiking your blood sugar within seconds. If you're fairly fit, there's probably enough there to fuel an hour of heavy exercise. But, when faced with the shortage, your brain can ask you to go eat (make you uncomfortable and hungry) or can conserve energy by asking you to keep still (making you cold/weak/tired) - it might do both, but the homeostasis process is just trying to guard your energy stores.

Of the five main types of Asbestos fiber, the most commonly used type is Crysotile. The main hazardous characteristic of it is that when it becomes *fryable* the fibers tend to break into shards that have a weird physical structure that results in the ends of the fragments to have curled, hook-like ends that resemble microscopic velcro. The hooked ends are very good at sticking into tissue, and unlike fiberglass, silica, and other commonly inhaled harmful substances, the body cannot dislodge the particles as effectively. This results in the particles remaining in the body for MUCH longer, and that causes a body to resort to other means of self-preservation, such as encapsulation. When the body encapsulates an asbestos fiber, it deposits calcium around it and forms a layer of scar tissue around the deposit. One",

The main one is environment and lifestyle - feral horses often live in places without lush pasture where they must travel quite a bit to forage enough food. These are also often rocky places, so they wear down their hooves naturally (less opportunity to grow incorrectly or in unbalanced way) and the hooves may get enough feedback from hard ground to grow stronger. The second main factor is the type of movement and exercise horses are expected to do. In the wild, horses mostly move slowly and frequently, without a lot of hard impact from moving quickly. In domestication, horses are expected to trot and canter a lot, they jump or pull things, and the extra work means extra pressure on their feet and legs that a wild horse would only experience rarely.

Different types of cheeses require different temperature and humidity settings, so cheese shops that sell quality cheese often receive the cheeses'unfinished' and finish them in their own maturation cellars, of which they generally have several, each with different settings. Cheese producers generally sell their cheeses unfinished (unmatured), and let the cheese shops do the rest, which enables the shop owner to finish the cheeses as he or she sees fit, in their own style or preference. This is why you can take a non-mature goat cheese, say a Crottin de Chavignol, and finish it several different ways to produce different outcomes, depending on what the shop owner, who",

It is the squad keying method of modern combat. Modern combat keeps the keying of the person within one key and for all combatants the designation of the friendly is the key of C and associated and the enemy to be determined lurks outside of C. The egress point from C to the enemy in B is the resolvation G from a one or two bar of C. The common way to do this yields that people are fatter and taller especially, as the method yields octave resolvation which ultimately expand the keying of the person on a time basis towards being quite tall and weighty towards the end of the phase, and especially smaller at the beginning of the phase as the method starts with a single squad member, C2 or C3.

        "why cotton mouth can damage your teeth Dentist here long answer incoming. Perio is highly complex. It\u2019s not just that there is bacteria, it\u2019s that tooth loss usually occurs because of loss of periodontal support with plaque-induced inflammation. The inflammation can also have an adverse impact on jaw bone. At a minimum, gum recession, also known as loss of periodontal support, may occur but this is usually only detected and confirmed by clinical examination. However, there may be other underlying problems that lead to tooth loss and which may be only detected by diagnostic intraoral imaging.\nTooth loss means losing teeth in your mouth. As teeth gradually get lost as a result of gum disease and other issues, your teeth will start to shift, become misaligned, and drift out of place. Dr. Lee can help restore the natural balance in your mouth if the causes behind your missing teeth have been detected early.\nIn some cases, a person may have to have teeth removed if the surrounding gum tissue has irrevocably",

In laparoscopic surgery, this is commonly achieved by wrapping a piece of gauze or a clamp and sutures around a portion of the stomach wall. Bleeding from a cut is reduced by applying pressure or a piece of gauze and pressure is also applied as a means of holding a bone or another tissue in place.

They cannot be as fast, and I also wonder why they do not run away if they fall. Zebras cannot do this. Zebras would rather run than climb up, or fall down. Zebras must be gentle because they have one eye on the front and one down the back. They cannot make a good choice between the two and may have only one eye at a time. I think they would be good as animal models for the blind. I believe the zebras' hind legs are shorter than their front legs and their legs are longer that their necks.\nZebras are large and gentle animals. They have one eyeball and one eye down the rear but",
        "If holding bladder is harmful, why isn't it an issue while sleeping? When your sleeping your body produces a hormone callled anti diuretic (diuretic is the chemical that causes someone to urinate). This hormone helps prevent your kidneys and bladder from producing more urine than they need to. When you sleep, your body produces less of these hormone which allows your kidneys and bladder to produce more urine. While in a medical perspective, this probably would not cause health issues, this is a very common thing to people who suffer from incontinence. To some people they suffer from the inability of their bladder to relax. I was experiencing similar and found that if your holding your bladder it is easy for it to become tired and lose control. In my case I would wake up with a bladder full of urine. In my case I would wake up with a bladder full of urine. In the morning, urinating felt like a chore and it was difficult.

        "Why did humans get stuck with periods while other mammals didn't? It\u2019s because we are always fertile, instead of coming into heat a few times a year. We don't have any reason to go through it unless we want to.\nIn an attempt to explain how humans menstruate, a lot of experts have suggested that it's possible that our periods started when modern-day Homo sapiens migrated to Africa - over 10,000 years ago. The African populations that were in existence in that timeframe didn't menstruate yet, but they did have a reproductive process that was more similar to how it would be today.\nWhy didn\u2019t they menstruate? Well, the answer is very simple. Humans evolved to have periods because of their lifestyle and dietary habit. A lot of the populations in Europe were quite isolated, and did a lot of hard physical work. As a result, they didn\u2019t have to put any effort into maintaining their reproductive cycle, because the reproductive process would take care of itself. Also, they ate foods which were mostly",

Reposting this classic explanation from u/jiggity_gee So your bowels work like a washing machine, and food is delivered to them in tiny drops that flow down your abdomen. When food reaches the rectum, a small muscle on the outside pushes out the contents, and then the entire contents of the rectum are pushed out the anus with the muscle. So when you eat food and it hits hard against the wall of your rectum, it pushes out a lot of water, waste, and other fluids, and that pushes your bowels out a lot. When you eat less food it makes it to the rectum less, and the defecate process is slower so you go longer between. Not the best advice but I hope it helps.

Why does a sugar test give high values after eating, even if the sugar has already been fully absorbed by the small intestine?\nThe blood sugar spike after a meal arises from the fact that in the stomach digestion begins, where the enzymes (proteins) start breaking down the food. The enzyme digests the protein into smaller, chemical components and in this process the sugar is converted into glucose. As a result of this conversion, the carbohydrates (that is glucose + sugar) is transformed into sugar. So your blood sugar rises. However, the digestion of carbohydrates, or the conversion into sugar, only takes place in the stomach. Therefore, the glucose is first removed from the blood by the liver, but the level of glucose in the liver is low and therefore no significant rise occurs.\nAfter digesting, the glucose",

A soil mix is recommended for those plants that do not like to sit in an overly saturated environment for long periods of time.\n- In a world of hydroponic plants, it's easy to confuse plants. The root ball you see on a label isn't always the plant itself. In hydroponics, the plant is placed in a solution containing nutrients, water and other additives.

Freshwater fish such as carp tend to be higher in iodine than the saltwater fish. It feeds on many things including insects, crustaceans, mollusks and even some mammals and amphibians. This is the longest-lived fish on the planet. This fish gets some of its nutrients from plankton, algae, and detritus. When eating fish you will want to leave the fins and scales behind.

        "if a morbidly obese person suddenly stopped eating anything, and only drank water, would all the fat get burnt before this person eventually dies from water deprivation. If the person were to continue eating normal food, he or she would gain weight. If a normal weight woman were to eat nothing but vegetables and be very careful with water, she would not turn into a morbidly obese person (Braunstein, 2009) .\nThe other important factor is what one eats. One shouldn't eat food in isolation from the rest of one's normal diet. A person should think about their own eating habits, their relationship to food, and the consequences. What one eats is often a big factor in determining one's weight, yet most people don't think about what they eat or don't eat. It's important to eat food that is healthy.

Isn't alcohol molecule the same for all these drinks?\n\nA:\n\nYou can measure the impact of the same alcoholic drink using the same amount, at the same time. So if you measure both how much alcohol a person does or how much blood alcohol concentration the individual has, you will get results of the same magnitude.\n\nBut that is the wrong way to ask the question. How do the different alcohols hurt us?\n\nThe answer is a little more complicated. For the human body, the thing that matters, much more than the molecule itself, is the total amount the body spends during its metabolism. This can happen through either breaking down the molecule (making ethanol, and other less harmful metabolites), or storing it. This is controlled to a large extent by the liver. In humans, the amount this organ spends, on average, is almost 200g of alcohol per",

        "What has caused maternal mortality to rise so dramatically in the US since 2000? To lay out a few facts: This NIH study shows that the US birth rate now stands at the lowest the country has seen since the 1940s. Birth rates are a critical measure of fertility rate. A drop in birth rates over a number of years signifies a decline in births as well as the level of fertility in the population. At the same time, more births mean more live births and the number of stillbirths. The NIH study also shows that even as the birth rate fell (and stayed at its lowest level for more than 40 years), the number of babies who lived still far exceeded the number of babies who died. There were also more babies born with low birth weight and preterm (birth before the baby's 37th week of gestation) and more babies born with genetic and complex medical conditions. Not only are mothers with health problems a greater risk of maternal death, there is",

Compression stockings are a great option for anyone dealing with poor circulation. They help improve the blood flow to extremities, aid in recovery, and decrease soreness from exercise and other activities. At the core of this is increased blood flow to muscles that work hard and a lowered resistance to blood flow to the feet. Since the heart is forced to work harder to pump blood through smaller arteries, it helps relieve the strain on your heart and allows more blood to flow to all parts of the body.

        "Why can't things be sterilized by time? Well, it depends on the pathogen in question. Most viral particles quickly become non-viable on a hospital ward, and that's pretty much the same for bacteria. But if we're talking about fungal organisms, there are still some viruses that are so robust that they continue to infect cells after a period in which they have lost their ability to multiply. This process is called \"retroviral\" replication.\nSome retroviruses have a relatively short life cycle. The HIV virus, for example, is responsible for much of the world's HIV-related illnesses, and for its initial stages, it remains active as many as five days before it dies. It's a relatively simple retrovirus, and once it gets inside a host cell it will begin its life cycle by replicating itself and then using its genes to produce a number of new viral particles. But in the case of some viruses, retroviral replication is more complex. The virus can also replicate itself outside the host",

This isn't simply a matter of the fetus not having enough force or being unable to generate the volume of air they do need to do the act. There are several other factors at play, such as their limited body size and lung capacity, that make it unlikely that the infant can develop a strong respiratory muscle for puking.

        "How are viruses like the common cold able to continue existing if they are never \"successful\" and are killed off by our species' immune system? They can persist because their progeny are continuously being produced even if they are not able to successfully replicate (\"survival of the fittest\").\nIn order to transmit to hosts, viruses have the ability to enter host cells. How is it possible for viral particles (or parts of them) to enter cells? The mechanism is called endosomal escape, and the viral particles can use three major strategies for this.\nViruses enter the cell by binding to a receptor on the cell surface that they recognize. If they do not have a specific receptor, they can hijack molecules produced by cells or viruses that can bind other receptors. For example, HIV-1 requires the use of the chemokine CD4, which is produced by lymphocytes to attach to cells.\nAlternatively, viruses can enter by using the endocytic machinery of the cell.

This is not a time where you should be overhydrating.\nAs a general rule, you don\u2019t do much harm by drinking less than you have to. But you should be careful about doing too much, or trying to stay a little below your body weight.\nA great deal of the controversy is driven by the idea that drinking water during exercise is a good idea, in order to preserve muscle glycogen. The reason why this works is that the main factor determining where glycogen stores tend to go is the amount of energy you use. So if you have much more energy than you need it, then most of it will go to generating it. But for people who don\u2019t regularly exercise, the storage",

        "Why does alcohol make stress and depression \"go away\" almost instantly but is making it worse in the long run? There are multiple factors involved in this, but one important reason is detox. While it helps you feel better, it also makes you feel worse after it stops working. The feeling of an empty belly also stimulates the brain to send out signals that cause the mood and anxiety to return. The combination of these effects can be so powerful that it can push anyone to commit suicide.\nIt is true that drinking can seem beneficial at first, especially in times of stress. But over a longer period, the negative effects far outweigh any initial happiness. So, as you get older, stop drinking and drink only occasionally, at celebrations, family gatherings, etc. Instead, get out and get active.\nThere is nothing that will improve depression naturally like physical activity.

First, the rate of air flow though the entire nasal cavity, which includes the sinuses, is a matter of controversy. While some people say 10 seconds of airflow is required for proper functioning, others claim a mere 1 second is needed. To me it seems that at least one side of the debate is wrong. It is a bit like trying to use your own breath to determine the rate at which you breathe, just because you have your own breath of choice. If you are trying to ascertain the rate of air delivery to your lungs, you would need to employ a special method such as spirometry or the Douglas bag to detect actual airflow rates. In this instance, we are not even trying to ascertain air flow rates. We are trying to ascertain whether sinus blockage occurs in the face of a mild allergy so as to determine how much air is being delivered to the nose.",

The key to preventing future water retention is finding the source and eliminating it.\nWater retention is a natural process where water is stored in your body. This is a normal function to give your body the water it needs. Water is the major body fluid and the most common form of water retention is in the form of swelling. Swelling of your body is simply how much water your body can\u2019t or will not lose without it being replaced. It is a natural process that your body uses to balance the water/acid balance.

        "why does the human brain allow for such high intelligence compared to any other species? It's a great question, and we aren't completely sure. One newer theory is that intelligence is the sum of different abilities or \"modules\". A module would have a different cognitive function. When a module is not functioning, intelligence would be reduced. Some modules are shared across all species. An example of this is the visual system. Another example is the language system, which was previously thought to be unique to humans. So how is this different to the other modules, such as visual processing, memory, problem solving, etc, which are thought to be unique to humans? A few points to consider: First, many of these things in the human brain are shared with other animals. For example, we share 98% of our genes with chicken. This means that the same cognitive system is used in the brain for all species. While visual processing is different in different animals, there is one basic system of cells (the visual cells",

But then the next question of course: Is there anyone responsible to protect us from rabies?\nHere",
        "If your leg gets amputated, how does your body know to not produce enough blood to replace what was lost? The answers so far are crappy and allude a medical miracle. I will be interested to hear more.\nYou may be interested to take note that we have more blood than we think. The body is made up of a lot of water, but it\u2019s actually made up of about 60 percent blood. Even when we consider the fluid that fills out our organs and circulates in our systems, it\u2019s about 60 percent. So when we think that we\u2019re losing blood in a cut, we\u2019re not quite losing enough, and yet something goes awry. I believe that for whatever reason, the body just stops producing blood to replace what had been lost. The idea that we\u2019ll lose more blood than we actually do would seem to be supported by the fact that an organ or limb that is removed, but not immediately discarded becomes necrotic for up to several days.

        "Why does it seems that children usually have a much greater physical disposition/stamina than the average adults? lets look at numbers. Say a kid weighs 60 lbs. and runs 20 mph, which is about 5 miles per hour. A 60-lb adult can only run 7.5 mph. Also a kid of 16 runs at 12 mph, which is pretty normal, so would only run about 4.5 miles per hour.\nAlso a kid can run at a much greater height than most adults could, hence reaching farther down the field, and hitting more of the balls. Also much faster, which can help make up for some of the bad swing mechanics that many kids have.\nThe thing that I have to admit is the average kid these days seem to work harder than the average adult does on average but to me it seems really like a lot of the time kids are still doing more than just enough to get through any school year.

A lot of hangovers are intensified by dehydration, but that might only exacerbate the problem in more susceptible individuals. Some studies have suggested that dehydration makes the headaches worse, but there\u2019s also a hint that drinking more water might prevent the headache.

        "why did us humans become way taller from 1900 to 1990? Is there a scientific reason to it? Why are we not becoming any taller in recent years? Is there any proof for what causes our genetic traits to grow?\nMy current understanding is that there is a decrease in the growth hormone, and the way I know that is because when I was growing up, I always had a higher chance of gaining weight than my younger brother, even though we grew up in a similar environment and had similar eating habits. Also growing up I was very muscular and I was always bigger than him. I was also told a hundred times about the benefits of growth hormone.\nNow, I don't know any science but I do know that what I grew up hearing are also popular theories. There is very little evidence to support either of them. My theory is that because growth hormones are needed for bone growth, and we humans have less bones in our body we therefore don't need a lot of growth hormones.\nDoes anyone know anything about",
        "Why are shoes made so narrow to the point that it changes the bone structure of our foot? There had to be a benefit at some point so make shoes bigger with an extra inch or two?\nYou can make shoes a little tighter and they'll keep them on your feet better. Shoes too big fit loosely and can wedge your foot. Shoes too tight keep your toes in place but can cause them to pull out. It's really a matter of balance in our foot because if they fit snug, the muscle goes to work to hold it in place but then if they don't fit correctly you find the muscles don't help too much and they're just going to hurt.\nSo it's really a matter of choosing the right size for your feet and not having to always wear shoes that are slightly tighter than what they say they are. Most shoes these days are a little to tight in the toe and a little too wide in the front. I like to give myself a comfort zone where I'm not",
        "Why didn't the indigenous people who lived on the savannahs of Africa domesticate zebras in the same way that early European and Asians domesticated horses? I don't think that's what's going on.\n\nA:\n\nIn general, there is a tradeoff. The domestication of a plant/animal that can live in a particular ecosystem can provide advantages that benefit the people living there (e.g. by providing a specific food source, preventing diseases, improving the environment, etc.). However, such domestication might also come at a cost to the people in other parts of the world, as plants and animals that have been domesticated in one area have become adapted to the climate, environment etc. in that region. In other words, a particular domestication of a plant/animal can provide benefits to the people from there, but it might also create an environment that the people in other parts of the world will find unsuitable for their lives.\nIn the case of zebras, this is a",
        "How does NASA ensure that astronauts going into space for months at a time don\u2019t get sick? You are right about the vetting and medical training. But it is also part of the training for astronauts to learn to do certain tasks while in space, like washing clothes, and they learn to maintain proper hygiene when going out to the outskirts of the planet. They also wear gowns when walking outside because the astronauts don\u2019t want dirt or germs from the outside world to land on their skin or clothing.\nI think those are fantastic things. I actually remember watching a documentary on it, and when you have thousands of people wearing similar clothing for a long period of time, there is a problem with people getting lice in it. So one part is keeping things clean as far as hygiene goes. The reason the astronauts wear the gowns is because in the future they might eventually want to work on Mars, and they will want to wear clothes that allow them mobility on that planet",

This thing is called a [hypnic jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk_(sleepwalking)), which is an important part of the body's awakening defense system.\nSleep paralysis is most commonly experienced as it is referred to as: when a part of the body does not move due to a loss of consciousness. When a limb is not moving a person does not know the limb is not moving \u2013 and is not conscious of it. The brain does not think about the limb still remaining in that state, a state called a 'semi-sleep state', which allows one to maintain awareness of surroundings \u2013 though not of oneself.
